## Company description

*Adid* is a communications company with its core values centered around safety,
privacy and speed.  In its current form it is represented as an offline /
decentralised networking app, powered by QR codes. The app enables users to
share their contact details, chosen to include business or personal information.
Thus, *adid* is a business networking as well as a social association service, not
a social network or platform.  *Adid*’s further intentions are to progress on its
values by incorporating different technologies for varying circumstances, such
as near-field-communication as well as broadening the means of using the values
and technologies, to not only communicate contact details. A specific example
would be the proposed sharing of nearby, local events. This vision would
encompass offline chatting and other sorts of functional data transfer for a
less centralized future of sharing information.

## Target markets

Potential customers to the service are to be segmented into few primary and
several secondary markets. Primary markets have been identified through UX
research and user persona analysis and are the business networking sector and
the nightlife/entertainment-social sphere. Main marketing efforts are focused on
growth in the primaries via representation on networking and business summits as
well as social events. Secondary markets are thus music and other cultural
events for the personal segment. Collaborations with event management firms and
professional networking businesses as well as associations is a vital resource
for marketing and growing the service to projections.

## Competition

No active competition has been directly identified. A few inactive firms have
been found with issues for their closure different in nature to any potential
issue currently to be thought of for “*adid*”. The lack of competition and
in-existence of a similar service or products indicate the innovation present and
barriers to entry that have been posed and overcome. Firms projected to become
competitors in the future progression of the firm are much greater of a
potential thread. Traditional communications companies would become one of the
projected main competitors, opposing a decentralized communication service over
their traditional systems, although the potential of collaboration and
integration is to be possible just as much as potential opposition. 

## Milestones

A few major milestones have been set out to be achieved for the coming five-year
period. Within the first year, the company’s team should be optimized and
broadened to primarily and effectively market the service and promote growth.
Secondly, the development focus should also be directed towards a “progressive
web app” to be completed before the first one-and-a-half-years in order to
include all mobile operating systems. Also, Expansion is planned to take place
internationally, fueled by the collaboration with networking associations
already in contact with, representing business’ as well as personal /
entertainment’ collectives. The development of the current app in terms of
additional features should also be increased in count and improved upon in
quality by the second year, in which major feature additions outside of current
scope and a UI re-design are scheduled. A gamification approach to the current
business model could be introduced in this stage of the development phase, as
well as other sources of revenue from related markets. The second year is
comprised of major expansion schedules and additional collaborations executed
with peripheral networking associations, which would include secondary market
targets such as music event networking. The third year should introduce the
formation of a board and the attraction of bigger firms for collaboration,
assuming rising awareness in prior years. Furthermore, the business case should
dramatically be broadened in this time period, to drive annual revenue.

# Business model canvas


## Key partners 

Key partners are networking associations and event management firms for the
business sectors as well as entertainment/social sector. Both segments
respectively represent the primary and secondary markets mainly pursued for
potential customers. The aim is to utilize relationships with key partners to
increase awareness and drive growth. Later, these partnerships will create
stability for a robust barrier to entry and limitation to competition.

## Key resources

The key resources are already partially present in the current team in terms of
required skillsets. Materialistic key resources will be comprised of development
equipment and infrastructure. Since the service is supposed to be decentralized
and offline, the costs for serving and computing is much lower than
traditionally. Less materialistic but much more relevant and essential are the
mentioned relationships, as it is the major planned driver for growth. 

## Key activities

Besides further development and marketing, which should be taking place
regularly, the search for further collaborative entities is planned. Less
frequently, UX research should be carried out within the first two years to
perform necessary adaptions. 

## Cost structure

In opposition to traditionally run digital services, *adid* works decentralized
and offline, thus there is no need for any servers or infrastructure other than
the website and the planned “progressive web app”. The most expensive projects
would be such as the inclusion of a blockchain powered, offline, decentralised
chat/messaging service.

## Value proposition

The value that *adid* proposes, based on the personas identified in UX research
about the target markets, is not brand new and thus expensive technology, but
rather the aggregation of existing technologies in innovative, new ways. *Adid*
helps people connect and network effectively in a quick, private and simple way.
For individuals at an event, *adid* allows them to quickly share their details
with like-minded people. 

> *"Take no longer than 10 seconds to exchange contact details!"*
 
> *"With adid, you don't have to spend time or thoughts on how to exchange
> your details the best way."*

## Revenue streams

Currently in development, is the premium version of *Adid*, which will become one
of the major revenue streams. Affiliate marketing with other firms using *Adid*’s
technology for decentralized information distribution is another stream of
revenue, as well as the licensing of the service to enterprise. In contrast to
B2C measures, the premium version targets consumers directly. 

## Customer relationships

Acquisition and retention are driven by relations formed with key partners,
whereas maintenance and stability are to be done in-house as well as through
promotion through events. 

## Channels

Promotional advertisements on digital platforms like “the app store” or
websites/blogs will complement offline advertising via mentioned partnerships
and events.

## Customer segments

The business networking, primary market comprises the major part of segments
present for potential customers. The entertainment/social-event complements the
business target with personal consumers. Furthermore, these segments can be
broken down and specified further to market the service even more effectively.
Thus, more specialized events and associations can be approached to utilize a by
*adid* provided networking service.
