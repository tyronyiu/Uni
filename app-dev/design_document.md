### System Implementation Methodologies

- Incremental Development
- Research and Development: Invest and Dare
- Waterfall Development:  Step by Step
- Rapid Prototyping: A quick solution for the best to come
- Parallel Development:  Break the development and work concurrently for the solution
- Iteration Development: Develop the problem in general, and keep on solving by improving the solution. 
- Partial Development: Develop only a part
- Spiral Development: Develop after deeply undemanding the problem
- Agile Development:   Develop as you go and adjust the solving method to the circumstances and the challenges
- V Development: Requirements Validation based Development 
 
- **Software development lifecycle**

### Software Requirements Management

> A software requirements specification (SRS) is a description of a software
> system to be developed. It lays out functional and non-functional
> requirements, and may include a set of use cases that describe user
> interactions that the software must provide.

-------------

### Non-Functional Requirements

> Requirements, which are not related to functional aspect of software, fall
> into this category. They are implicit or expected characteristics of software,
> which users make assumption of.
>
> Non-functional requirements include
>
> - Security
> - Logging
> - Storage
> - Configuration
> - Performance
> - Cost
> - Interoperability
> - Flexibility
> - Disaster
> - recovery
> - Accessibility

-------------

### Functional Requirements

> Requirements, which are related to functional aspect of software fall into
> this category.They define functions and functionality within and from the
> software system.  
>
> EXAMPLES:
>
> - Search option given to user to search from various invoices.
> - User should be able to mail any report to management.
> - Users can be divided into groups and groups can be given separate rights.
> - Should comply business rules and administrative functions.
> - Software is developed keeping downward compatibility intact.

-------------

### User Interface requirements

> UI is an important part of any software or hardware or hybrid system. A
> software is widely accepted if it is:
>
> - Easy to operate
> - Quick in response
> - Effectively handling operational errors
> - Providing simple yet consistent user interface 
 
*User interface requirements are briefly mentioned below:*

> - Content presentation
> - Easy Navigation
> - Simple interface
> - Responsive
> - Consistent UI elements
> - Feedback mechanism
> - Default settings
> - Purposeful layout
> - Strategical use of color and texture.
> - Provide help information
> - User centric approach
> - Group based view settings

**Must have VS. Should have VS. Could have**

------------------

### Other considerations

- **Partnerships needed?**
- **Future development plan**
    - future features and ambitions
- **Current development plan**
    - How the project will be develop with the requested funds? 

------------------

## Design Document

> A technical design document that will cover the project implementation plan
> with emphasis on the technology development methodology, the application's
> technical design, the user interface design, and the operations/ functionality
> process flow. The design document shall cover the operations and functionality
> flow in a creative and simplified ways that can user friendliness and
> usability.

**Work breakdown structure**

Task                               | Note
-----------------------------------|--------------------------
Project implementation plan        | Choice of above mentioned
Technology development methodology | Choice of above mentioned
Application's technical design     | No idea what he exactly means, guessing its about technical features or how those features are implemented design-wise, like the "enter code" feature..
UI design                          | Description of choices made seen in prototype
Process flow                       | Flowchart
Operations & functionality         | Must, should, could have features of above mentioned

## Working Prototype

done

## Presentation

- Brief introduction into what the app is (in one sentence)
    - for whom (target audience)
        - user personas
- Relevant / important choices made in the prototype.
- Functionality outlined (must, should, could)
- UI explained
- Typical user journey
- Innovations applied
- Business stuff like revenue streams, pricing strategies (freemium,
  subscription model, premium version, ads), operating costs etc.
