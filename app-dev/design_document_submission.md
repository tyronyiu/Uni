## Project implementation plan

### System implementation Methodologies

Agile development has been used in the past, in order to get to market quickly.
From there on, a combination of incremental with the V development methodology
has been adopted, as to ensure quality, which is often suffering under
methodologies's quick nature. 
The V methodology is rather reflective of modern software design engineering,
aligning with a in strength having risen trend called [*'atomic
design'*](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/), in which components are
used to emerge to higher-order components to create whole designs.

## Software requirements management

As *Adid's* conception and implementation heavily rely on certain technologies,
specific requirements have to be met, in order for the development to be
thoroughly planned and not endure setbacks through missing deliverables on time
or for failing quality tests.

### Non-functional requirements

> Implicit or expected characteristics

The app should be intuitive to use, achieved through mimicking the operating
system's native application style, thus complying with the device designer's
guidelines and overall design language. Native components are ought to be used
majorly over custom components as to reduce confusion. As of the new standards
of the IOS design language, dimensions of time and space should be considered.

In order to enhance and differentiate the app's experience, a constant presence
of *depth* has been integrated into the most essential component of the
user interface, the menu and navigation at once (well, less of navigation, as
the app could be considered *single-page;SPA*).

### Functional requirements

The main functionality that *adid* requires, revolves around creating specially
encrypted QR codes.
All major functionality can be described by *string concatenation*. This
*string* represents your *adid code*, which is then transformed into a qr code
representation of itself.

### User interface requirements

The user interface should be based on apple's standard *human interface
guidelines* and follow apple's design language in order to provide the most
intuitive experience possible to the user.


### Other considerations

- **Partnerships needed?**
- **Future development plan**
    - future features and ambitions
- **Current development plan**
    - How the project will be develop with the requested funds?
