# Risk Management

$$
\text{Risk severity} = \text{Impact} * \text{Probability}
$$

> Probability usually as a percentage.
> Keep even zero possibility risks in list.

> Identification of exact nature of risk and what it exactly impacts. e.g.
> delivery date or logistics.
> After identification of affected area, impact is assessed in measurable terms
> like monetary damage.

Thus, a threshold should be set above and below which risks are tried to avert
or neglected.

## Risk responses

- Avoid
    - alter plannings to eliminate risk's presence.
    - "hosting an event inside instead of outside"
- Mitigate
    - reduce probability and/or impact and increase opportunity in probability
      and/or impact.
    -  "moving the event to summer season; a helmet reduces the impact, but not
       the probability"
- Transfer
    - transfer the risk to someone else.
    - insurance
- Accept
    - Have contingency plans and reserves or ignore the risk.

## Cost Management

> Ensures presence within budget realm.

**Cost estimating**
- Development of budget estimation based on work items.
**Cost budgeting**
- Allocation of overall cost to constituent items.
**Cost control**
- Reviewing actual to estimates and performance reviews.

- Life cycle costing
    - total cost of ownership, or development plus supports costs, for a
      Project.
- Cash flow analysis
    - Determines estimated annual costs and benefits and resulting cash flow of
      the year.

**Cost Types**
- Tangible costs
- Intangible costs
- Direct costs
    - directly related to producing the products and services of the project.
    - materials and labour used for constructing the actual *bridge*
- Indirect costs
    - not directly related, but to project's performance.
    - marketing costs for a *bridge*
- Sunk costs
    - spent in the past, unobtainable cost; ignore past costs for decision
      making in the presence.

- Direct
- Indirect
- Recurring
- Non-recurring
- Fixed
- Variable
- Normal
- Expedited

**Learning Curve Theory**
States that when many items are produced repetitively, the unit cost of those
items decreases in a regular pattern as more units are produced.

**Reserves**
> included in a cost estimate to mitigate cost risk by allowing for future
> situations that are hard to predict.

- Contingency reserves
    - allows for future situations that may be partially planned for (known
      unknowns) and are included in the project cost baseline.
- Management reserves
    - allow for future situations that are unpredictable. (unknown unknowns)

### Cost Estimates

Why cost estimates often fail:
- Estimates are done too quickly
- External factors
- Lack of definition
- Underestimating bias

Accuracy of estimates vary due to listed reasons, thus a range for shifts should
be set. This should be unequal to both sides, e.g. -5%, +15%.

**Analogous / Top-down estimates**
- use the actual cost of a previous, similar project as the basis for
  estimating the cost of the current project.
- The bottom up method my require too much work involvement to repetitively
  create on for all projects.

**Bottom-up estimates**
- involve estimating individual work items or nativities and summing them to get
  a project total.
- more accurate than Analogous estimates.

**Parametric modeling**
- uses project characteristics (parameters -> *parametric*) in a mathematical
  model to estimate project costs.

**Cost Baseline**
- Same values as in Budget, but mapped through time.
- Wages are recurring monthly, where as construction material may be a one-off
  purchase.

### Cost Control
- Monitoring cost performance
- Ensuring that only appropriate project changes are included.
- Informing stakeholders of any changes
