## Negotiation

Negotiation is a conversation between two or more people or parties who are working to reach a beneficial outcome.
Each party has their own aims, needs and viewpoints.
Often the parties are seeking to find common ground to settle a matter of mutual concern. 

## The 7 Elements of Negotiation

Interests
: Interests are “the fundamental drivers of negotiation, ”according to Patton—our basic needs, wants, and motivations. 


Legitimacy
: The quest for a legitimate, or fair, deal drives many of our decisions in negotiations. 


Relationships
: Whether you have an ongoing connection with a counterpart or don’t think you’ll ever see her again, you need to effectively manage your relationship as your negotiation unfolds.


Alternatives and BATNA
: Even as we take part in negotiations, we are aware of our alternatives away from the table—what we will do if the current deal doesn’t pan out. Always spend time on your BATNA


Options
: In negotiations, options refer to any available choices parties might consider to satisfy their interests, including conditions, contingencies, and trades. They can create value in negotiation and improve parties’ satisfaction, according to Patton.


Commitments
: In negotiations, a commitment can be defined as an agreement, demand, offer, or promise made by one or more party. 


Communication
: Whether you are negotiating online, via phone, or in person, you will take part in a communication process with the other party or parties. 



## Bargaining

Bargaining or haggling is a type of negotiation in which the buyer and seller of a good or service dispute the price which will be paid and the exact nature of the transaction that will take place, and eventually come to an agreement.
Bargaining is an alternative pricing strategy to fixed pricing.

A few thoughts for Effective Negotiations Fisher, Ury, Patton (2015)

* Any negotiation where the relationship is the primary concern runs the risk of producing a shabby agreement.
* Determine your BATNA -the Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement.
* Your power in negotiations is tied directly to the quality of your BATNA, not resources such as wealth, physical strength or political connections.
* Use questions instead of statements, and use silence as a weapon.
* Ask questions, then pause. You are doing some of your most effective negotiating when you are not talking.
* When all else fails, call in a third party mediator.

* Separate the people from the problem.
* Focus on interests, not positions.
* Generate a variety of possibilities before deciding what to do.
* Insist that the result be based on some objective standard.

Human beings don’t communicate clearly and they mix their egos with their positions.
Attack the problem instead of the people.

* People
* Interests
* Options 
* Standards

## BATNA

BATNA is the most advantageous alternative course of action a party can take if negotiations fail and an agreement cannot be reached.
This could include diverse situation, such as suspension of negotiations, transition to another negotiating partner, appeal to the court's ruling, the execution of strikes, and the formation of other forms of alliances.
A party should generally not accept a worse resolution than its BATNA.

* Invent a list of actions you might take if no agreement is reached. 
* Improve the ideas with the most potential and convert them into practical alternatives.
* Tentatively select the best alternative

## Framing

The frame
: The way you package and present your proposal. Matters as much as its substance. Framing is powerful because it allows you to make proposals that are basically the same “more or less attractive simply by how you present them.”

## Impediments to agreements

* Die-hard bargainers
* Informational vacuums and the negotiator’s dilemma
* Structural impediments
* Spoilers
* Cultural and gender differences
* Communication problems
* The power of dialogue
* Lack of trust
