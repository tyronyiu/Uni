In a 2,500 words (+/- 10%) report describe and analyse the role of the public
sector in a chosen country. Conduct proper research and  The areas of interest
may include but are not limited to: the historic development of the public
sector, the size of the public sector, taxation, welfare provisions, the role of
state in the economy.

**Any special aspects?**

- I believe there is a wealth tax and/or higher than usual income tax

- There’s unusually high public spending in Belgium relative to other
  European countries. This is due to the decision to increase public
  spending made in 2008 following the financial crisis, aiming to increase
  economic activity and provide stability. (Which it did) since then though,
  public spending hasn’t been radically changed.
- A quick search about the public sector in reference to Belgium revealed
  recent Labour strikes, heavily criticizing the public spending of the
  government. (What is this about, considering the last bullet-point?) 

## Executive Summary


## Introduction

The monarchic constitutional federation of Brussels, divides power between the
king as head of state and the prime minister as head of a multi-party
government. The government is threefold and equally
powered in decision making processes. The three language and region based
communities have different responsibilities to pursue. [^1]
(Belgium is a official seat for European institutions.)
With a declining population of 11.2 millions and same trend following GDP of
49,512 US$ per capita, Belgium is a well-developed free market economy typical
for its size and location within the Euro-zone. There's 7.1% unemployment in the
labour force, though Belgium has the second highest social spending among the
OECD countries and a total of 52.2% of GDP general government spending. 

> Belgium performs well in many measures of well-being relative to most other
> countries in the Better Life Index. Belgium ranks above the average in
> work-life balance, income and wealth, civic engagement, education and skills,
> subjective well-being, health status, social connections, and personal
> security but below average in environmental quality. These rankings are based
> on available selected data.
> Money, while it cannot buy happiness, is an important means to achieving
> higher living standards. In Belgium, the average household net-adjusted
> disposable income per capita is USD 29 968 a year, less than the OECD average
> of USD 30 563 a year. There is a considerable gap between the richest and
> poorest – the top 20% of the population earn about four times as much as the
> bottom 20%. [^2]

## The role of the public sector in Belgium 
As above mentioned, the role of the public sector is executed by the federal
regional / language-based communities, the king has its role being subtle and
discreet relative to the execute powers of the communities/regions. 

> "Belgium is a federal state, composed of communities and regions 
> 
> The power to make decisions is no longer the exclusive preserve of the
> federal government and the federal parliament. The leadership of the country
> is now in the hands of various partners, who independently exercise their
> authority within their domains." (Belgium, a federal state, 2013) [^3]

> Presenting the survey in Brussels at a news conference alongside Belgian Prime
> Minister Charles Michel, OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría said: “In a
> difficult global context, it is encouraging to see that Belgium’s economy is
> gathering speed, albeit at a modest pace compared to pre-crisis levels. There
> is much to be positive about, and Belgium possesses the necessary
> determination to address the significant challenges it continues to face. A
> focus on public investment and tax and education reforms are important actions
> in order to boost growth and make it more inclusive, so everyone benefits.”

The federal government is made up of 15 ministers having general executive and

- Taxation:

> Ever since the introduction of the new legislation of Article 6 of the VAT
> Code of July 1, 2007 – which has been altered numerous times since then – a
> lot has changed for the Belgian governments. In general it can be said that
> the VAT duty has been extended.
