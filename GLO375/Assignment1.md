In a 2,500 words (+/- 10%) report describe and analyse the role of the public
sector in a chosen country. Conduct proper research and  The areas of interest
may include but are not limited to: the historic development of the public
sector, the size of the public sector, taxation, welfare provisions, the role of
state in the economy.

**Any special aspects?**

- There’s unusually high public spending in Belgium relative to other
  European countries. This is due to the decision to increase public
  spending made in 2008 following the financial crisis, aiming to increase
  economic activity and provide stability. (Which it did) since then though,
  public spending hasn’t been radically changed.
- A quick search about the public sector in reference to Belgium revealed
  recent Labour strikes, heavily criticizing the public spending of the
  government. (What is this about, considering the last bullet-point?) 

## Executive Summary


## Introduction 

The monarchic constitutional federation of Brussels, divides power between the
king as head of state and the prime minister as head of a multi-party
government. The government is threefold and equally powered in decision making
processes. The three language and region based communities have different
responsibilities to pursue. [@1] With a declining population of 11.2 millions
and same trend following GDP of 49,512 US$ per capita, Belgium is a
well-developed free market economy typical for its size and location within the
Euro-zone. There's 7.1% unemployment in the labour force, though Belgium has the
second highest social spending among the OECD countries and a total of 52.2% of
GDP general government spending. In fact, their high public spending is a
primary function they utilise to stimulate economic activity and provide
stability, as they did following the financial crisis in 2008. [@2]

## The role of the public sector in Belgium 
As mentioned, the role of the public sector is executed by the federal
government and supplemented by regional and culture (language)-based communities,
the king has its role being subtle and discreet relative to the execute powers
of the communities/regions. 

> "Belgium is a federal state, composed of *communities* and *regions*

> The power to make decisions is no longer the exclusive preserve of the federal
> government and the federal parliament. The leadership of the country is now in
> the hands of various partners, who independently exercise their authority
> within their domains." [@3]

> The Federal government retains control over the judicial system, the army, the
> Federal police, labour law, social security (unemployment, pensions, health
> insurance), public debt, prices, income and wage policy financial sector and
> financial markets [@Economic_survey_of_Belgium_2017] 

The reason for this responsibility distribution is economic autonomy and
cultural considerations, which have emerged over the historic development of the
public sector of Belgium and their overall politics. Geographical regions can
adapt aspects relating to the economy, employment and public works depending on
the local economic activities, developments and political situation.[@4]
Cultural differences within the regions of Belgium are also reason for the
regions having emerged in the first place. Thus, *the communities* have
controlling powers over aspects including education, health policies or
assistance for individuals requiring assistance (social welfare).[@5]

Tax revenue in Belgium 
[@OECD_Taxation_Belgium]

Belgium's Public spending in areas such as education is more than 2% above the
average OECD country's GDP[@8]. *The communities* have executive power regarding
education related decisions and have to consider the three languages and
cultures represented within the country. Hence, the three autonomous educational
system in Belgium, *Flemish, French & German*, thus having issues managing a
fragmented decentralised education system, in terms of consistency of quality
and opportunities. Considering that the educational system experiences issues
with the threefold, decentralised communal system, it becomes clear that
similar issues may arise in the management of other departments of the public
sector's social welfare provision. Managing these issues correctly is apparently
an ongoing issue for Belgium, as public spending is described as "inefficient"
in the *Economic Survey of Belgium 2017 [@Economic_survey_of_Belgium_2017]*.

Belgium has the second highest social spending among the OECD countries [@9], which
aligns with the plans to stimulate economic activity and invest in social public
spending. Belgium, enabled through having such high social spending, has the
highest ranking *public unemployment spending* of any OECD country, in fact, it
is more than double the average OECD member country's [@10]. Not only does
Belgium spend a lot on unemployment benefits/compensations, but also on the
labour market in form of subsidies, training or direct job creation in the
public sector [@11]. Unemployment has been decreasing, while employment rate of the
total labour force has been steady [@IMF].

> [@IMF2019ArticleIV]

Not only did he quit because of a UN mitigation pact, but also because of severe
difficulties with the social complexity and cultural community considerations
that have to be made, underlying the real difficulty of managing the
*threefoldness* of Belgium. [@TheGuardianBelgiumGovernmentCollapse] Labour
unions are agitated and have been for a while. These recent strikes /
interference from labour unions [@NYTimesBelgiumStrikes] resulted in a tighter
labour market and increased wages, seeing implementation in the new labour
market reforms and overhauled wage moderation.

> "The government implemented a number of reforms designed to reduce
> unemployment traps, increase labor market participation, and introduce more
> flexibility in the labor market."[@IMF2019ArticleIV] 

*"The Tax Shift"* [@IMF2019ArticleIV] is another implementation Belgium made in
order to relieve the working individual.

> The Tax Shift (...) aims to improve competitiveness and strengthen purchasing
> power by shifting taxes away from labor. The reform, which was targeted
> especially to low wage earners, entails lowering social security contributions
> for employers and employees and reducing personal income taxes for employees.
> Partially compensating measures include higher excise duties on alcohol,
> tobacco, diesel (...) [@IMF2019ArticleIV]

Thus, price inflation will follow the rise in disposable income. High and
increasing public business investment spending is counteracting the tax vacuum.
[@7]

Belgium's employs a fully-funded statutory pension scheme, where 7.5% & 8.7% are
contributed by employee and employer respectively, but non-deducted from income.
Pension spending is similar to Germany and Spain in terms of percentage of GDP
spent. There’s a ¼ more pensions spending compared to the OECD average. In fact,
*"The projected substantial rise in pension expenditure over the long term is
one of the highest in Europe"* [@OECD_Pension_policy_notes_Belgium]. (It has
been recommended by the OECD to shift taxes away from the working individual via
corporate social security contributions.)
