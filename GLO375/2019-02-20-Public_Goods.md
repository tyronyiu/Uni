## Rival Consumption & Exclusion

To distinguish between private and public goods, it depends on whether the good
has the property of rival consumption and whether it is possible to exclude any
individual from the benefits of the good (without incurring great costs).

Thus, rival consumption means that if a good is used by one person, it cannot be
used by another person. Non-rival consumption refers to cases in which one
person's consumption does not detract from or prevents another person's
consumption. The second question relates to the property of exclusion. Can
someone be excluded from the consumption of a good? If exlusion is impossible
(or too expensive), then the use of price system is impossible because consumers
have no incentive to pay the price.

## Underconsumption, oversupply and user fees

If consumption is non-rival but exclusion is possible, market might lead to
*underconsumption* as the marginal benefit is higher than the marginal cost
(zero). But if there is no charge there will be no incentive for supplying the
good. In this case, inefficiency takes the form of *undersupply*.

If exclusion is possible, even if consumption is non-rival, governments can
charge *user fees*, to those that benefit from a publicly provided good or
service. E.g. toll roads, airline ticket tax. User fees are thought of as a
fairer way of raising revenues, as those who use the public facility the most
(presumably benefit the most) pay the most. However, consumption when non-rival,
will lead to user fees introducing inefficiency.
