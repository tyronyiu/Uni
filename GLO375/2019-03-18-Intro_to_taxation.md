Taxes are an **involuntary** fee levied on individuals or corporations that is
enforced by a government entity, whether local, regional or national in order to
finance government activities. Unlike most transfers of money, which are entered
into voluntarily, taxation is compulsory. In previous classes we showed that
government must intervene in order to provide adequate amount of public goods.
We also showed that contributions to support public services need to compulsory
to avoid the free rider problem.  

## Is Taxation theft?
Such forced transfers have been likened to theft. However there is a major
difference: transfers through the government wear the mantle of legality and
respectability conferred upon them by the political process. When the political
process in a country becomes detached from the citizenry and its used to
transfer resources to the groups in power, the distinction between taxation and
theft becomes blurred at best. 

## Principles of Taxation
### Adam Smith's four principles for taxation 
1. Equality: taxes should equally burden all individuals or entities in similar
   economic circumstances.  
   - Equality of sacrifice: the burden of taxation should involve an equal
     sacrifice for every individual. 
   - Ability to pay:  taxes should be levied according a taxpayer's ability to
     pay. 
2. Economic Efficiency: tax collection efforts should not cost an inordinately
high percentage of tax revenues.
3. Convenience: taxes should be enforced in a manner that facilitates voluntary
compliance to the maximum extent possible.
4. Certainty/Predictability: collection of taxes should reinforce their
inevitability and regularity. 

### More principles of Taxation
**Adequacy**: taxes should be just-enough to generate revenue required for
provision of public services. 

**Broad Basing**: taxes should be spread over as wide as possible section of
the population, or sectors of economy, to minimize the individual tax burden. 

**Neutrality**: taxes should not favour one group or sector over another, and
should not be designed to interfere-with or influence individual
decisions-making. 

**Simplicity**: tax assessment and determination should be easy to understand
by an average taxpayer

## Effects of Taxation
- Behavioral Effects 
- Financial Effects 
- Organizational Effects 
- General Equilibrium Effects

## Announcement effects
Economy does not adjust automatically to a tax. Often the long term distortions
are bigger than the short term distortions, as the economy is able to respond
more fully to the new circumstances. However, in some cases the effects of a tax
may be felt even before the tax is imposed, simply upon announcement. We call
those effect announcement effects. For example, the announcement of a future
increase in property tax, will impact the construction industry even before tax
is imposed.  

## Distortionary and Non-distortionary Taxation
A tax is *nondistortionary* if, and only if, there is nothing an individual or firm
can do to alter the tax liability. Economists call taxes that are
*nondistortionary* lump-sum taxes.An example would be a head-tax, a tax one has to
pay regardless of income, consumption or wealth. However, most taxes are
*distortionary*. If a tax is imposed on income, an individual can reduce his/her
liability by simply working less hours. If a tax is imposed on consumption of a
product, an individual can reduce his/her liability by simply purchasing less
units. 

## Types of Taxation
In 1696 in England, was introduced the Window tax. Houses with more than ten
windows had to pay a steep ten shillings. Many houses bricked up their windows
to reduce the number which caused health problems. After 156 years, it was
repealed in 1851 following campaigners branded it a "tax on health" and "tax on
light and air".In 1698, Russia instituted a beard tax to bring Russian society
in line with Western European models. Police could forcibly and publicly shave
those who refused to pay the tax.If you're in a hot air balloon in Kansas but
it's tethered to the ground, the experience is taxed at a rate of 6.5%. But if
the balloon is set free, it means you're traveling from one place to another
(technically considered "air commerce") and therefore the ride is tax-free.In
New York, a bagel by itself is exempt from tax. But if you slice a bagel or
smear anything on it, then it's a "prepared food" 

### Direct and Indirect Taxes
There are two broad categories of taxes: direct taxes on individuals and
corporations and indirect taxes on goods and services.
**Direct taxes include:**
- Taxes on income: personal income tax, payroll tax, social security
  contributions, capital gains tax, corporate tax 
- Taxes on wealth: estate tax, inheritance tax, solidarity tax 
**Indirect taxes include:**
- Taxes on Consumption/sales: VAT, sales tax, excise taxes (tobacco, alcohol
  etc.) 
- Taxes on Imports/Exports: tariffs/duties

### Per unit or *Ad Valorem* Taxes
A per unit taxis a set amount of tax per unit sold, such as a 10p tax on packets
of cigarettes. In contrast, an *ad valorem* tax is a percentage tax based on the
value added by the producer, such as a 20% VAT.

### Tax evasion and avoidance
Both aim to reduce tax liability. Tax Evasion is illegal. Breaking the letter
and the spirit of the law. Tax Avoidance is Legal. Breaking the spirit, not the
letter of the law. 

### Income Tax
An income taxis a tax imposed on individuals or entities (taxpayers) that varies
with their respective income or profits (taxable income).Income can be taxed at
source (payment of income is done after the deduction of tax) or can be taxed
after receipt of income. E.g. Pay as you Earn (PAYE) vs Self Assessment.

### Sales Tax
A value-added tax (VAT), also known in some countries as goods and services tax
(GST), is a type of general consumption tax that is collected incrementally,
based on the increase in value of a product or service at each stage of
production or distribution. 

### Sales Tax Vs. VAT
VAT (Value-Added Tax) is collected by all sellers in each stage of the supply
chain. Suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers all collect the
value added tax on taxable sales. All pay the VAT on their purchases. Businesses
must track and document the VAT they pay on purchases that will be resold in
order to receive a credit for the VAT paid on their tax return. Tax
jurisdictions receive the tax revenue throughout the entire supply chain as
opposed to at the sale to the final consumer chain.In United States there is no
VAT (the only OECD country without one). Instead a sales tax is collected by the
retailer when the final sale in the supply chain is reached via a sale to the
end consumer. End consumers pay the sales tax on their purchases. Unlike VAT,
sales tax is levied on the total value of goods and services purchased.

### Excise Tax

Excise taxes or duties are taxes paid when purchases are made on a specific good
or service. Often in attempt to reduce its consumption. Excise taxes are
sometimes referred to as sin taxes.Although referred to as taxes, most times
they are duties as they are levied at the moment of manufacture, rather than at
sale. An excise is typically a per unit tax that applies to a narrow range of
products and is typically heavier, accounting for a higher fraction of the
retail price of the targeted products. As a deterrent, excise is typically
directed towards three broad categories of harm:

- health risks 
- environmental damage
- socially damaging / morally objectionable activity

An earmarked tax is a tax whose revenues are by law reserved solely for a
specific usage. Monies raised through excise may be *earmarked* for redress of
specific social costs commonly associated with the product or service on which
it is levied.
