Taxes are an **involuntary** fee levied on individuals or corporations that is
enforced by a government entity, whether local, regional or national in order to
finance government activities. Unlike most transfers of money, which are entered
into voluntarily, taxation is compulsory. In previous classes we showed that
government must intervene in order to provide adequate amount of public goods.
We also showed that contributions to support public services need to compulsory
to avoid the free rider problem.  

## Is Taxation theft?
Such forced transfers have been likened to theft. However there is a major
difference: transfers through the government wear the mantle of legality and
respectability conferred upon them by the political process. When the political
process in a country becomes detached from the citizenry and its used to
transfer resources to the groups in power, the distinction between taxation and
theft becomes blurred at best. 

## Principles of Taxation
### Adam Smith's four principles for taxation 
1. Equality: taxes should equally burden all individuals or entities in similar
   economic circumstances.  
   - Equality of sacrifice: the burden of taxation should involve an equal
     sacrifice for every individual. 
   - Ability to pay:  taxes should be levied according a taxpayer's ability to
     pay. 
2. Economic Efficiency: tax collection efforts should not cost an inordinately
high percentage of tax revenues.
3. Convenience: taxes should be enforced in a manner that facilitates voluntary
compliance to the maximum extent possible.
4. Certainty/Predictability: collection of taxes should reinforce their
inevitability and regularity. 

### More principles of Taxation
**Adequacy**: taxes should be just-enough to generate revenue required for
provision of public services. 

**Broad Basing**: taxes should be spread over as wide as possible section of
the population, or sectors of economy, to minimize the individual tax burden. 

**Neutrality**: taxes should not favour one group or sector over another, and
should not be designed to interfere-with or influence individual
decisions-making. 

**Simplicity**: tax assessment and determination should be easy to understand
by an average taxpayer

## Effects of Taxation
- Behavioral Effects 
- Financial Effects 
- Organizational Effects 
- General Equilibrium Effects

## Announcement effects
Economy does not adjust automatically to a tax. Often the long term distortions
are bigger than the short term distortions, as the economy is able to respond
more fully to the new circumstances. However, in some cases the effects of a tax
may be felt even before the tax is imposed, simply upon announcement. We call
those effect announcement effects. For example, the announcement of a future
increase in property tax, will impact the construction industry even before tax
is imposed.  

## Distortionary and Non-distortionary Taxation
A tax is *nondistortionary* if, and only if, there is nothing an individual or firm
can do to alter the tax liability. Economists call taxes that are
*nondistortionary* lump-sum taxes.An example would be a head-tax, a tax one has to
pay regardless of income, consumption or wealth. However, most taxes are
*distortionary*. If a tax is imposed on income, an individual can reduce his/her
liability by simply working less hours. If a tax is imposed on consumption of a
product, an individual can reduce his/her liability by simply purchasing less
units. 

## Types of Taxation
In 1696 in England, was introduced the Window tax. Houses with more than ten
windows had to pay a steep ten shillings. Many houses bricked up their windows
to reduce the number which caused health problems. After 156 years, it was
repealed in 1851 following campaigners branded it a "tax on health" and "tax on
light and air".In 1698, Russia instituted a beard tax to bring Russian society
in line with Western European models. Police could forcibly and publicly shave
those who refused to pay the tax.If you're in a hot air balloon in Kansas but
it's tethered to the ground, the experience is taxed at a rate of 6.5%. But if
the balloon is set free, it means you're traveling from one place to another
(technically considered "air commerce") and therefore the ride is tax-free.In
New York, a bagel by itself is exempt from tax. But if you slice a bagel or
smear anything on it, then it's a "prepared food" 

### Direct and Indirect Taxes
There are two broad categories of taxes: direct taxes on individuals and
corporations and indirect taxes on goods and services.
**Direct taxes include:**
- Taxes on income: personal income tax, payroll tax, social security
  contributions, capital gains tax, corporate tax 
- Taxes on wealth: estate tax, inheritance tax, solidarity tax 
**Indirect taxes include:**
- Taxes on Consumption/sales: VAT, sales tax, excise taxes (tobacco, alcohol
  etc.) 
- Taxes on Imports/Exports: tariffs/duties

### Per unit or *Ad Valorem* Taxes
A per unit taxis a set amount of tax per unit sold, such as a 10p tax on packets
of cigarettes. In contrast, an *ad valorem* tax is a percentage tax based on the
value added by the producer, such as a 20% VAT.

### Tax evasion and avoidance
Both aim to reduce tax liability. Tax Evasion is illegal. Breaking the letter
and the spirit of the law. Tax Avoidance is Legal. Breaking the spirit, not the
letter of the law. 

### Income Tax
An income taxis a tax imposed on individuals or entities (taxpayers) that varies
with their respective income or profits (taxable income).Income can be taxed at
source (payment of income is done after the deduction of tax) or can be taxed
after receipt of income. E.g. Pay as you Earn (PAYE) vs Self Assessment.

### Sales Tax
A value-added tax (VAT), also known in some countries as goods and services tax
(GST), is a type of general consumption tax that is collected incrementally,
based on the increase in value of a product or service at each stage of
production or distribution. 

### Sales Tax Vs. VAT
VAT (Value-Added Tax) is collected by all sellers in each stage of the supply
chain. Suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers all collect the
value added tax on taxable sales. All pay the VAT on their purchases. Businesses
must track and document the VAT they pay on purchases that will be resold in
order to receive a credit for the VAT paid on their tax return. Tax
jurisdictions receive the tax revenue throughout the entire supply chain as
opposed to at the sale to the final consumer chain.In United States there is no
VAT (the only OECD country without one). Instead a sales tax is collected by the
retailer when the final sale in the supply chain is reached via a sale to the
end consumer. End consumers pay the sales tax on their purchases. Unlike VAT,
sales tax is levied on the total value of goods and services purchased.

### Excise Tax

Excise taxes or duties are taxes paid when purchases are made on a specific good
or service. Often in attempt to reduce its consumption. Excise taxes are
sometimes referred to as sin taxes.Although referred to as taxes, most times
they are duties as they are levied at the moment of manufacture, rather than at
sale. An excise is typically a per unit tax that applies to a narrow range of
products and is typically heavier, accounting for a higher fraction of the
retail price of the targeted products. As a deterrent, excise is typically
directed towards three broad categories of harm:

- health risks 
- environmental damage
- socially damaging / morally objectionable activity

An earmarked tax is a tax whose revenues are by law reserved solely for a
specific usage. Monies raised through excise may be *earmarked* for redress of
specific social costs commonly associated with the product or service on which
it is levied.

### Wealth Tax
A wealth tax (also called a capital tax or equity tax) is a levy on the total
value of personal assets, including: bank deposits, real estate, assets in
insurance and pension plans, ownership of unincorporated businesses, financial
securities, and personal trusts. Unlike income, wealth is an accumulation.
Income is a recurring incoming flow of money. A wealth tax is often frowned
upon, due to the fact that income is already being taxed, and the wealth tax
thus ultimately adds an already *existing* tax.

## Tax Systems
### Tax rate, average tax rate and marginal tax rate
#### Tax rate 
is the ratio (usually expressed as a percentage) at which a business or person
is taxed.

#### Tax liability (T)
Is the total amount of tax due.

#### Tax base (B) 
Is the measure upon which the assessment or determination of tax liability is
based. E.g. income is the tax base for income tax, value is the tax base for
property tax 

#### Average tax rate (t)
Is the ratio of the total amount of taxes paid to the total tax base, often
expressed as a percentage 

$$ t = T/B $$

#### Marginal tax rate
(MTR or t’)is the tax rate an individual would pay on one
additional dollar of income. It is the ratio of change in tax liability to the
change in tax base 

$$ MTR = \delta T/ \delta B $$

### Progressive, Proportional and Regressive Taxation
A **progressive tax** is a tax imposed so that the tax rate increases as the
taxable amount increases. For a progressive tax $MTR > t$
- Personal Income Tax is usually a Progressive tax.

A **proportional tax** is a tax imposed so that the tax rate is
fixed, with no change as the taxable base amount increases or decreases. For a
proportional tax $MTR = t$
- VAT and Corporate Tax are often proportional taxes

A **regressive tax** is a tax imposed  so that the tax rate decreases as the
amount subject to taxation increases. For a regressive tax $MTR < t$
- National Insurance Contributions in UK have a regressive character as there is
  a cap above which you pay a lower rate

### Arguments against progressive taxation
> Progressive taxation generates a more complicated a less applicable tax system
> - In a democratic society progressive taxation might lead to politically
> irresponsible solutions (tyranny of the majority / tyranny of the masses)

### Arguments for progressive taxation
- Progressive taxation is an *automatic stabilizer* for the economy.
  Progressiveness makes smoother the fluctuations of the economic cycle. During
  the recovery/growth phase progressive tax (T) increases faster than income
  (Y), so the disposable income (income after tax) increases slower. Of course
  the opposite happens during the recession. 
- People with higher income have more opportunities to gain income. For example,
  some investments are only available to people with a minimum amount to invest.
- The needs covered with further income increases have a lower value from a
  societal perspective. 
- Progressive taxation counterbalances other taxes which are essentially
  regressive, like VAT and many consumption taxes.  

$$\text{Disposable income (y_d)} = y - T + B$$

## Tax incidence
### Tax burden and tax incidence, tax shifting
The **tax burden** is the true economic weight of a tax. Economists distinguish
between those who bear the burden of a tax and those on whom the tax is imposed
or levied. The burden is not just the quantity of tax paid (directly or
indirectly), but the magnitude of the lost consumer or producer surplus. The
concepts are related but different.A £1,000/pint of beer tax will raise no
revenues (sales will stop), but will reduce both consumer and producer surplus.

**Tax incidence** is a term used for the analysis of the effect of a particular
tax on the distribution of economic welfare. (What is the incidence of the tax?
= Who actually pays the tax?)
**A tax shifts forward** when the burden falls on the consumers than the
suppliers.
**A tax shifts backwards** when the burden falls on a production factor. There
might be full shift, partial shift, or no shift.
