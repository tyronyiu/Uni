Taxes are an involuntary fee levied on individuals or corporations that is
enforced by a government entity, whether local, regional or national in order to
finance government activities.Unlike most transfers of money, which are entered
into voluntarily, taxation is compulsory. In previous classes we showed that
government must intervene in order to provide adequate amount of public goods.
We also showed that contributions to support public services need to compulsory
to avoid the free rider problem.  

## Is Taxation theft?

Such forced transfers have been likened to theft. However there is a major
difference: transfers through the government wear the mantle of legality and
respectability conferred upon them by the political process. When the political
process in a country becomes detached from the citizenry and its used to
transfer resources to the groups in power, the distinction between taxation and
theft becomes blurred at best. 

## Adam Smith's four principles for taxation

1. Equality: taxes should equally burden all individuals or entities in similar
   economic circumstances.  
   - Equality of sacrifice: the burden of taxation should involve an equal
     sacrifice for every individual. 
   - Ability to pay:  taxes should be levied according a taxpayer's ability to
     pay. 
2. Economic Efficiency: tax collection efforts should not cost an inordinately
high percentage of tax revenues.
3. Convenience: taxes should be enforced in a manner that facilitates voluntary
compliance to the maximum extent possible.
4. Certainty/Predictability: collection of taxes should reinforce their
inevitability and regularity. 

## More principles of Taxation

**Adequacy** : taxes should be just-enough to generate revenue required for
provision of public services. 

**Broad Basing** : taxes should be spread over as wide as possible section of
the population, or sectors of economy, to minimize the individual tax burden. 

**Neutrality** : taxes should not favour one group or sector over another, and
should not be designed to interfere-with or influence individual
decisions-making. 

**Simplicity** : tax assessment and determination should be easy to understand
by an average taxpayer
