Taxes are an involuntary fee levied on individuals or corporations that is
enforced by a government entity, whether local, regional or national in order to
finance government activities.Unlike most transfers of money, which are entered
into voluntarily, taxation is compulsory. In previous classes we showed that
government must intervene in order to provide adequate amount of public goods.
We also showed that contributions to support public services need to compulsory
to avoid the free rider problem.  

## Is Taxation theft?

Such forced transfers have been likened to theft. However there is a major
difference: transfers through the government wear the mantle of legality and
respectability conferred upon them by the political process. When the political
process in a country becomes detached from the citizenry and its used to
transfer resources to the groups in power, the distinction between taxation and
theft becomes blurred at best. 

## Principles of Taxation

### Adam Smith's four principles for taxation 
1. Equality: taxes should equally burden all individuals or entities in similar
   economic circumstances.  
   - Equality of sacrifice: the burden of taxation should involve an equal
     sacrifice for every individual. 
   - Ability to pay:  taxes should be levied according a taxpayer's ability to
     pay. 
2. Economic Efficiency: tax collection efforts should not cost an inordinately
high percentage of tax revenues.
3. Convenience: taxes should be enforced in a manner that facilitates voluntary
compliance to the maximum extent possible.
4. Certainty/Predictability: collection of taxes should reinforce their
inevitability and regularity. 

### More principles of Taxation

**Adequacy**: taxes should be just-enough to generate revenue required for
provision of public services. 

**Broad Basing**: taxes should be spread over as wide as possible section of
the population, or sectors of economy, to minimize the individual tax burden. 

**Neutrality**: taxes should not favour one group or sector over another, and
should not be designed to interfere-with or influence individual
decisions-making. 

**Simplicity**: tax assessment and determination should be easy to understand
by an average taxpayer

## Effects of Taxation

- Behavioral Effects 
- Financial Effects 
- Organizational Effects 
- General Equilibrium Effects

## Announcement effects

Economy does not adjust automatically to a tax. Often the long term distortions
are bigger than the short term distortions, as the economy is able to respond
more fully to the new circumstances. However, in some cases the effects of a tax
may be felt even before the tax is imposed, simply upon announcement. We call
those effect announcement effects. For example, the announcement of a future
increase in property tax, will impact the construction industry even before tax
is imposed.  

## Distortionary and Non-distortionary Taxation

A tax is *nondistortionary* if, and only if, there is nothing an individual or firm
can do to alter the tax liability. Economists call taxes that are
*nondistortionary* lump-sum taxes.An example would be a head-tax, a tax one has to
pay regardless of income, consumption or wealth. However, most taxes are
*distortionary*. If a tax is imposed on income, an individual can reduce his/her
liability by simply working less hours. If a tax is imposed on consumption of a
product, an individual can reduce his/her liability by simply purchasing less
units. 

## Types of Taxation

In 1696 in England, was introduced the Window tax. Houses with more than ten
windows had to pay a steep ten shillings. Many houses bricked up their windows
to reduce the number which caused health problems. After 156 years, it was
repealed in 1851 following campaigners branded it a "tax on health" and "tax on
light and air".In 1698, Russia instituted a beard tax to bring Russian society
in line with Western European models. Police could forcibly and publicly shave
those who refused to pay the tax.If you're in a hot air balloon in Kansas but
it's tethered to the ground, the experience is taxed at a rate of 6.5%. But if
the balloon is set free, it means you're traveling from one place to another
(technically considered "air commerce") and therefore the ride is tax-free.In
New York, a bagel by itself is exempt from tax. But if you slice a bagel or
smear anything on it, then it's a "prepared food" 

### Direct and Indirect Taxes

There are two broad categories of taxes: direct taxes on individuals and
corporations and indirect taxes on goods and services.
**Direct taxes include:**
- Taxes on income: personal income tax, payroll tax, social security
  contributions, capital gains tax, corporate tax 
- Taxes on wealth: estate tax, inheritance tax, solidarity tax 
**Indirect taxes include:**
- Taxes on Consumption/sales: VAT, sales tax, excise taxes (tobacco, alcohol
  etc.) 
- Taxes on Imports/Exports: tariffs/duties
