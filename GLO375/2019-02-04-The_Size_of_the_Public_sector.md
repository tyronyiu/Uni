## Problems when using public finances

The aspect of *off-budget item* contains all state-owned companies and
participations in private companies held by the state. State owned companies
have their own budgets and accounts, thus we miss that information in our
reports. Maybe a government own that many state owned enterprises, but have so
much regulations/rules that they basically do control other companies. E.g. not
providing medicine themselves, but regulating the market price for their
economy, this way the government has *indirect control*. The *hidden costs of
government* contains all those regulatory activities of the state which do not
directly affect the state expenditures, but which result nevertheless in high
costs for those who have to adapt to the regulations. Over-regulation and
extensive bureaucracy for example lead to hidden costs because growth is
hampered and at the same time private resources are bound inefficiently.
