## Property Rights
### Tragedy of the commons and tragedy of the anticommons

Property rights are necessary for any market.The absence of property rights or
non well-defined property rights mean that there are no adequate incentives of
taking care the commonly owned resources. 

> **Example:**
> In the former communist countries, property rights were not well defined and
> people had insufficient incentives to maintain and/or improve their apartment.
> In market economies, the benefits of such improvements are reflected in the
> market price of the properties.
