## Property Rights
### Tragedy of the commons and tragedy of the anticommons

Property rights are necessary for any market.The absence of property rights or
non well-defined property rights mean that there are no adequate incentives of
taking care the commonly owned resources. 

> **Example:**
> In the former communist countries, property rights were not well defined and
> people had insufficient incentives to maintain and/or improve their apartment.
> In market economies, the benefits of such improvements are reflected in the
> market price of the properties. 

The tragedy of the commons, is term used to describe a situation within a
shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to
their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by
depleting or spoiling that resource through their collective action.

### Proposed Solutions

For a long time the common response to the problem of the commons was either
conversion of common resources to private or the external regulation of these
common resources.

- If the resource is converted to private property, the owner should have both
  the profit incentives and the property rights to manage the resource
  responsibly. 

- If the resource is regulated by the government, rules could be imposed on
  individual users for the common good.

In 1999, Nobel Prize-winning economist Elinor Ostromrevisited these solutions as
private control over previously public resources could create the usual problems
of monopoly business practices, whereas external oversight could generate
inappropriate and poorly implemented regulations.

- She noted a third response to the tragedy of the commons: Utilization of
  community social capital to devise creative and effective local solution. 

## The tragedy of the anticommons

Michael Heller used the term tragedy of the anticommonsto describe a problem
where is not the lack of property rights, but the excessive private ownership of
a community resource that prevents achievement of a desirable outcome for
society.

> **Example:** Patenting of genes

## Contract Enforcement
### rights need protection

If individuals are engaged in transactions with each other, the contracts they
agree on must be enforced. If they are not and there are no consequences for
breaking a contract then there will be no trust in the market. Government
activities aiming at protecting citizens and property, enforcing contracts, and
defining property rights provide the foundations on which market economies rest. 

## Market Failures

> When there is no invisible hand, or when the invisible hand is broken, or when
> the invisible hand points to the wrong direction

Markets are not Pareto efficient under six important conditions, which are known
as market failures, and provide a rationale for government intervention. 

1. Failure of competition
2. Public Goods
3. Externalities
4. Incomplete Markets
5. Information Failures
6. Unemployment, Inflation, and Disequilibrium

## Failure of Competition

For markets to result in Pareto efficiency, there must be perfect competition, in
other words a sufficiently large number of firms that each believes it has no
effect on prices (price-takers). However perfect competition is not always the
prevailing norm. 

![Overview of imperfect competition](https://i.ibb.co/9HV8B96/market-failure.png)

### Imperfect competition leads to economic inefficiency

Under imperfect competition, firms set the marginal revenue from one extra unit
equal to the marginal cost. With a downward-sloping demand curve, when a firm
sells an extra unit receives the price of the unit (+) but must lower the price
it charges on that and all previous units (-). Thus marginal revenue is less
than the price. Thus, monopoly output is lower than competitive output.

### What about natural monopolies?

A situation in which is cheaper for a single firm to produce the entire output
than for each of several firms to produce part of it is described as natural
monopoly.

If there is a natural monopoly, with declining average costs, and with marginal
costs below average costs, competition is not viable. If a firm charged a price
equal to the marginal cost it would operate at a loss (marginal cost < average
cost).

Even then, a private monopoly would typically charge more than a government
monopoly, as the private one seeks to maximize profitability, whereas the
government-run monopoly would only seek to break even. 

#### Public Goods

Some goods either will not be supplied by market or, if supplied, will be
supplied in insufficient quantity e.g. national defence, lighthouses. These
goods are known as *pure public goods*. Pure public goods have two critical
properties:

- It costs nothing for an additional individual to enjoy their benefits (MC=0,
  the cost of a lighthouse is not affected by the number of passing by ships)

- It is generally difficult or even impossible to exclude an individual from the
  enjoyment of a pure public good (If I put a lighthouse on a rock, I can’t
  exclude other ships from taking advantage of its presence).  

#### Market will not supply enough public goods

A ship owner with many ships might decide that the benefit of a lighthouse is
more than its construction cost. However when deciding how many lighthouses to
build he will only take into consideration his own benefit, and not that of
other ship owners. Thus there will be some lighthouses for which the total
benefits (taking into account all ships that make use of them) exceed the costs,
but for which the benefits of any single ship owner are less than the cost. Such
lighthouses will not be constructed which is inefficient.

#### Externalities

Some times the actions of an individual or firm affect other individuals or
firms (third parties). We refer to such instances as externalities. When the
actions of an individual or firm impose a cost on others for which they are not
compensated  we have negative externalities.When the actions of an individual or
firm conferring a benefit to others for which they don’t pay we have positive
externalities. 

##### Market ignores externalities

Whenever such externalities exist, the resource allocation provided by the
market will be inefficient:

- Individuals do not bear the full cost of negative externalities they generate
  and will engage in an excessive amount of such activities.

- On the other hand, individuals do not enjoy the full benefits of activities
  with positive externalities and will engage in too little of these.

### Incomplete and Missing Markets

Whenever private markets fail to provide a good or service even though the cost
of providing it is less than what individuals are willing to pay, there is a
market failure referred to as incomplete markets. E.g. Health insurance for the
elder, student loansA complete market would provide all goods and services for
which the provision cost is less than what individuals are willing to pay. 

#### Why do we have incomplete markets?

At least three answers have been proposed:

1. InnovationThere is often an undersupply of innovative new products in the
   insurance and security industries, which is why there is an important role
   for government in research.

2. Transaction CostsIt is costly to run markets, to enforce contracts, and to
   introduce new insurance policies. A private firm may be reluctant to do so if
   unsure whether everyone will buy the policy or whether will be able to reap
   the reward as competitors enter the market.

3. Asymmetries of Information and Enforcement CostsThe insurance company is
   often less informed about the nature of some risks than the person purchasing
   insurance. If risjis overestimated, the premium will be too high and the
   policy will not be purchased, if the risk is underestimated the premium will
   be too low and the insurer will lose money. It is a
   heads-you-win-tails-I-lose situation.

#### Asymmetric information and adverse selection

**Adverse selection** is a term used to describe the situation that arises when the
customers we have are the ones we would like to avoid. It is a result of
asymmetric information.

#### Missing Markets

Another reason for incomplete or missing markets is the absence of certain
complimentary markets. Assume that everyone drinks coffee with sugar. If sugar
is not produced then an entrepreneur considering producing coffee would not do
so, as he would realize that he would have no sales. In many cases, particularly
in less developed countries, large-scale coordination is required. Similarly
urban renewal programs require coordination among factories, retailers,
landlords, and other businesses.  

### Information Failures

Government activities, in many occasions, are motivated by imperfect information
on the part of the consumer, and by the belief that the market will supply too
little information. Information, in many respects, is a public good. Offering
information to one more individual does not reduce the available information to
the rest. Resources devoted to producing new knowledge –research and development
-can be considered a particularly important expenditure on information however
market on its own might engage in an insufficient amount of certain R&D
activities.

### Unemployment, inflation and disequilibrium

For many economists, the high levels of unemployment  are taken as prima facie
evidence that something is not working well in the market. The recent global
economic crisis hit several countries in Europe, with unemployment rates of 25%
and youth unemployment in excess of 50%.In a Pareto efficient market there
should be no unemployment (unutilized resources).

## Redistribution

> Even when the market is pareto efficient, society's happiness with the
> resource allocation might not be fulfilled.

The government may be required to intervene for a fairer income distribution.
This depends on the degree of happiness of the circumstance given by the
population. Competitive markets give rise to unequal distribution, leaving
insufficient resources for some.

#### Merit Goods

> Goods that society wants to be consumed, generating additional emergent value
> for society as a whole.

### Paternalism vs Libertarianism

Government intervention reasoned as in the interest of society is called
paternalism, where as the non-interference is called libertarianism.

Paternalism defends its view with the argumentation, that individuals do not
know what is best, considering their view is individuals and not collectivistic.

There are a few situations that defend paternalistic government intervention.
Such is a siuation revolving around *children*, questions about the
responsibility of the children. E.g. girls having to wear skirts for school.
Another situation is people that do stupid things or parents taking their
children out of school for vacation, but the school requiring the children to be
there. E.g. buying a house without earthquake insurance in an area notorious for
earthquakes to occur. This is a situation in which *the government cannot easily
commit itself to refrain from helping individuals who made poor decisions*.
