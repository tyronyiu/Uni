## Property Rights
### Tragedy of the commons and tragedy of the anticommons

Property rights are necessary for any market.The absence of property rights or
non well-defined property rights mean that there are no adequate incentives of
taking care the commonly owned resources. 

> **Example:**
> In the former communist countries, property rights were not well defined and
> people had insufficient incentives to maintain and/or improve their apartment.
> In market economies, the benefits of such improvements are reflected in the
> market price of the properties. 

The tragedy of the commons, is term used to describe a situation within a
shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to
their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by
depleting or spoiling that resource through their collective action.

### Proposed Solutions

For a long time the common response to the problem of the commons was either
conversion of common resources to private or the external regulation of these
common resources.

- If the resource is converted to private property, the owner should have both
  the profit incentives and the property rights to manage the resource
  responsibly. 

- If the resource is regulated by the government, rules could be imposed on
  individual users for the common good.

In 1999, Nobel Prize-winning economist Elinor Ostromrevisited these solutions as
private control over previously public resources could create the usual problems
of monopoly business practices, whereas external oversight could generate
inappropriate and poorly implemented regulations.

- She noted a third response to the tragedy of the commons: Utilization of
  community social capital to devise creative and effective local solution. 

## The tragedy of the anticommons

Michael Heller used the term tragedy of the anticommonsto describe a problem
where is not the lack of property rights, but the excessive private ownership of
a community resource that prevents achievement of a desirable outcome for
society.

> **Example:** Patenting of genes

## Contract Enforcement
### rights need protection

If individuals are engaged in transactions with each other, the contracts they
agree on must be enforced. If they are not and there are no consequences for
breaking a contract then there will be no trust in the market. Government
activities aiming at protecting citizens and property, enforcing contracts, and
defining property rights provide the foundations on which market economies rest. 

## Market Failures

> When there is no invisible hand, or when the invisible hand is broken, or when
> the invisible hand points to the wrong direction

Markets are not Pareto efficient under six important conditions, which are known
as market failures, and provide a rationale for government intervention. 

1. Failure of competition
2. Public Goods
3. Externalities
4. Incomplete Markets
5. Information Failures
6. Unemployment, Inflation, and Disequilibrium

## Failure of Competition

For markets to result in Pareto efficiency, there must be perfect competition, in
other words a sufficiently large number of firms that each believes it has no
effect on prices (price-takers). However perfect competition is not always the
prevailing norm.
