## Public Economics

**Political economy**
: Branch of social science studying relationships between individuals and
society, markets and state.

The **Economic Problem** Describes the unlimited wants and needs that do not
match scarce resources. This problem questions: *what to produce, how to
produce and for whom to produce*. Economics deals with these questions, Public
Economics cares about the role of the government in the economy.

- Inequality != natural

### Individual Report

Historic development of public sector, size, taxation, welfare provisions and
role of state in the economy (degree of intervention). 2,500 word report with
harvard referencing.

### What to produce?

The Production possibilities schedule/function can be used for determining how
much of what should be produced.

### How to produce?

- Private vs. Public production
    - State owned TV channel or privatised?
- Capital vs. Labour intensive production
- Energy efficiency?

### For Whom to produce?

*Question of distribution:* How taxation and welfare programs affect the
disposable income of different citizens. Different public goods appeal
differently to citizen groups.

### How are these decisions made?

When wondering how these decisions are made, issues of Public Choice arise. In
the public sector choices are made collectively.  Collective Decisions are far
more complicated, considering more factors and affected entities.

### Normative *vs* Positive Public Economics

**Normative Public Economics**
: Analysis of how things should be. (Should government intervention in the
health insurance market occur? How high should Taxes be?)

**Positive Public Economics**
: Analysis of how things *really* are. (Do higher taxes reduce Labour Supply?
Does government provided healthcare crowd out private health care insurance?)

Positive Public Economics is a required first step for completion of Normative
Public Economics. Positive analysis is primarily *empirical* and Normative
analysis is primarily *theoretical*

## The Government

Public Sector *(Public Enterprises or Corporations)* > General Government
*(Local government & provincial government)* > Central Government *(government
departments)*

There are Three Government Branches, *Stabilisation*, *Allocation* and
*Distribution*. The Public sector encompasses the General Government, which
encompasses the Central Government. 

*What do these discrete categories do?*

### In the economic system

![The Government within the Economic System](https://i.ibb.co/HH6xcMX/gov-in-economic-system.png)

### The Government provides the legal framework

There are *four* categories of economic activity for the government. The first
one is the production of goods and services, produced by the government itself.
Some examples could be public transport. The purchase of goods and services
opposed to the production, is like outsourcing production/service provision. An
example could be how governments buy electricity, transportation services *(HVV)*,
oil et cetera from private companies. Besides producing public goods,the
Regulation and subsidisation or taxation of private production is another
activity. E.g.  Setting minimum wages to ensure income, forbid certain goods,
set standards for production similar to food standards. Subsidies can be given
out for incentives, where as taxation can be used for reducing demand for
certain goods. E.g.  Education, research, energy are heavily subsidised. The
last activity is the government may just as well produce private goods such as
oil, telecommunication systems *(BT)* or electricity at a national scale through
the use of a public firm. Redistribution of income within the civilisation to
balance income inequality.

When talking about the production of goods & services, governments undertake
certain types of production directly differs from country to country. GLC,PPP &
PSP are new models for *privatisation vs. nationalisation*. Privatisation can
have advantages, such as allowing competition, or the fact that the privatée is
profit maximising, thus wanting to succeed more. On the other hand there are
disadvantages, such as the fact that public entities have near unlimited
budgets, given their existence depends on necessity. Nationalisation may be
implemented to tackle price ceilings, in reality, the reason for nationalisation
is saving a company with high significance from bankruptcy.  Measuring the
performance of the public sector, the best metric is employment.

There are three main types to subsidise, the direct payment to producers, which
is normally though of, the indirect payment through taxation *(e.g. sugar tax)*
and other hidden expenditures. *Government Credit* is a special form of subsidy
when below market interest rates, this is used as a safety-net. Regulation many
themes, such as the environmental protection Agency, that ensures the
public/private sectors impact on the environment.

Governments spend millions in purchases of goods and services, military
equipment, public transport, education services *(EF)*, construction et cetera
*(Carillion)* There are public assistance programs, such as cash or benefits, it
provides social insurance and redistributes collected taxes to achieve income
equality.

2. Responsibility of the government
3. Responsibility of the company
4. What can be done/could have been done to prevent these outcomes?

1. Too many employees, too many big projects, too many high paid managers, lead
   to the decline of share prices while debt accumulated (7 bn).

2. The responsibility to continue providing the services/products that were

### Direct & Indirect government intervention

*Direct government intervention* refers to the actual participation in the
economy, where as *indirect government intervention* refers to the regulatory
function of the government.
