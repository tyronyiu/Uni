In a 2,500 words (+/- 10%) report describe and analyse the role of the public
sector in a chosen country. Conduct proper research and  The areas of interest
may include but are not limited to: the historic development of the public
sector, the size of the public sector, taxation, welfare provisions, the role of
state in the economy.

- Any special aspects? 
	- I believe there is a wealth tax ([Belgium – New Tax on Resident and Nonresident - KPMG Global](https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2018/02/flash-alert-2018-024.html)) and/or higher than usual income tax
	- There’s unusually high public spending in Belgium relative to other European countries. This is due to the decision to increase public spending made in 2008 following the financial crisis, aiming to increase economic activity and provide stability. (Which it did) since then though, public spending hasn’t been radically changed.
	- A quick search about the public sector in reference to Belgium revealed recent Labour strikes, heavily criticizing the public spending of the government. (What is this about, considering the last bullet-point?)
