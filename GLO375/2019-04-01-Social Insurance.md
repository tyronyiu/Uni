## Social Security

> Social Insurance or Social Security are terms to describe the actions taken by
> governments to provide social protection to the people, and especially to the
> aged, the unemployed, and the disabled. The most important form of social
> insurance around the world is retirement insurance, which is provided through
> pension systems. 

### Private Insurance Problems

> Many private insurance products are available (e.g. car insurance, life
> insurance, home insurance). However there are certain issues when it comes to
> private provision of retirement insurance.

**High Transaction Costs**
: Private insurance companies spend a lot of money to analyse each individuals
risk and to market their products. Governments can make the purchase of social
insurance compulsory.

**Risk Mitigation**
: Inflation or poor stock market performance
can be detrimental to private insurance. A government can fill the gap using
public funds and can spread the cost through generations.

**Adverse Selection**
: A private insurance would be most likely purchased by those who are more
likely to use it (those in poor health or willing to retire early). Universal
insurance achieves risk diversification.

**Moral Hazard**
: Knowing that income is insured at retirement age and to an extend before that
age, someone could be incentivized to quit working although he/she is capable of
continuing (governments face the same problem).

### Social Insurance as a merit good

Even if private markets were efficient in providing retirement insurance,
remains a rationale for government action.If society does not want its senior
members suffering due to their poor saving choices, retirement insurance is seen
as a merit good and government can enforce a system where everyone must purchase
a minimum amount of it. 

### Fully funded vs Pay-as-you-go system

A pension system in which each age groupâ€™s pension is supported by its own
contributions is called a fully funded system. Private pension systems are
usually fully funded. Individuals contribute to a fund that is used to provide
for their pensions in retirement. A pension system in which the payroll taxes of
those in employment today pay for the benefits of those retired today is called
a pay-as-you-go system.Most countries in continental Europe have a pure or (most
likely) a modified pay-as-you-go system.
