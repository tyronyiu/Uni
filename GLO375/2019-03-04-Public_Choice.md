## Public vs Private choice

There is a question of the magnitude of public provision of public and private
goods. Market economy uses the price mechanism to reach an effective resource
allocation. Decisions about resource allocation in the public sectors are
different. Individuals vote for representatives and these elected
representatives in turn, vote for a public budget and money is spent by a
variety of administrative agencies.

### The problem preference revelations

Individuals express their desirability of one private good versus another by
simple action, buying. Elections of public officials convey only limited
information about voters attitudes towards specific public goods. At best, they
convey a general notion that voters prefer more or less government spending.

For example, polls show how strong sentiment against deficits, however
inconsistent picture emerges regarding the trade-offs. Some polls suggest that
voters would be willing to pay higher taxes and accept expenditure cuts, while
others don't. Unless faced with concrete trade-offs it is hard to get voters
think seriously about their choices.

In private decisions, the decision maker knows their own preferences. Where as
in public decision, the decision maker must ascertain the preferences of those
on whose behalf they are making the decision.

### Hidden preferences

Even if individuals were asked directly about their preferences the may hide
their true preferences: 

- If what they have to pay does not depend on their answer, people tend to
mand for more. People demand more of something they don’t have to pay for. 
- If what they have to pay does depend on their answer, people have an incentive
  to pretend that they enjoy the good much less than they really do. They know
  that their individual answer will have a negligible effect on the total amount
  supplied, and they would like to be free riders.

### Individual preference for public goods

Different individuals have different views on how much should be spent on public
goods or publicly provided private goods. Theocharis PapadopoulosThey differ for
three main reasons: 

1. Differences in tastes 
2. Income
3. Taxation 

Just as some people prefer one ice cream flavour over another. Similarly some
individuals prefer public parks and national defence, whereas others prefer
private goods such as restaurant dinners and cars. 

### Income and taxation effect on preference for public goods

The other two sources of differences in preference are income and
taxation. Individuals with higher income would normally like to consume more od
all goods, public and private. However their preference will be affected by the
price they are asked to pay. For private goods rich and poor pay the same
price. Regarding public goods, richer individuals usually face a higher price,
as they often contribute more to the additional taxes required to finance public
goods. The *tax price* is the additional amount an individual must pay when
government expenditure increases. If everyone pays the same richer individuals
prefer more public goods.If richer individuals often pay a higher tax price, the
will have a lower preference for public goods, while those at lower incomes will
have a higher preference. 

### The problem of aggregating preferences

In private markets, firms don’t have to balance the interests of one group
against those of another. If an individual is willing to pay a price for a
commodity above the marginal cost, then the firm has incentive to sell it.
Decisions are made on an individual basis. Contrary, in the public sector
decisions are made collectively. Apolitician voting to increase expenditure on a
public good does not spend his/her money. Politician is meant to represent
his/her constituents, but their opinions are not unanimous. Some might like more
military spending, other less. The problem of reconciling differences arises
whenever collective decision making is required. In a dictatorship, the answer
is easy: the dictator’s preferences dominate. However, things are more
complicated in democracy. 

## Voting Problems

> Majority voting and paradoxes

### Majority Voting

Simple majority voting is one of the most commonly used rules in democracy.
Suppose three individuals have to choose between spending on national defense
and education. They ask a vote and if two of them for education, that's where
the money is spent.

### The voting paradox (cyclical voting paradox)

However, things become more complex when dealing with multituted of options. For
example, allocating money to: defense, healthcare and education.

### Arrow's impossibility theorem

An ideal political mechanism should have four characteristics:

- Transitivity. If the rule shows that A is preferred to B, and B is preferred
  to C, then A should be preferred to C. 
- Nondictatorialchoice. The outcome does not simply reflect the preferences of a
  single individual.
- Independence of irrelevant alternative. The outcome should be independent of
  irrelevant alternatives. E.g. if we have to choose between A and B, the
  outcome should not be affected by the existence of a third alternative C. 
- Unrestricted domain. The mechanism must work no matter what the set of
  preferences and no matter what the range of alternatives over which choices
  are to be made.
 
Nobel Laureate Kenneth Arrow showed that there was no rule that would satisfy
all the desired characteristics. This theorem is referred to as Arrow’s
impossibility theorem.Government should not be expected to act with the same
degree of consistency and rationality as an individual.

### Single-peaked and double-peaked preferences

Even if it is imperfect, majority voting can give a determinate outcome when
there is a single peaked preference. However this is not always the case.

![Single Peak #1](https://i.ibb.co/hc13jVk/single-peak-1.png)

For instance, if the level of expenditure on education is below a certain
minimum level, a rich individual may prefer sending his/her children to private
schools. Thus his/her utility decreases with government expenditures up to a
critical level at which he/.se decides to use public education. For increases
beyond that level, the individual derives some benefit (up to the point that
taxes offset benefits).

![Single Peak #2](https://i.ibb.co/r41PNGW/single-peak-2.png)

For that individual a high level of expenditure is preferred to no expenditure,
but no expenditure is preferred to an intermediate level of expenditure.

#### Alternative Tax schedules

Paid in taxes | A   | B   | C
------------- |---- |-----|----
Poor          | 20% | 18% | 27%
Middle        | 20% | 18% | 21%
Rich          | 20% | 23% | 22%

```
Low + middle against rich -> B

low + rich against middle -> C

rich + middle against low -> A
```

### The median voter

When preferences are single-peaked we can rank individuals by their preferences.
The individual in the middle of this ranking is known as the **median
voter**. The outcome of majority voting corresponds to the preference of the
median voter. This is known as the median voter theorem.

In the table below, Jim is the median voter. If any level of spending below
$1,000 is voted against $1,000, Jim and those who want more than $1,000 vote for
Jim’s choice. If any level of spending above $1,000 is voted against $1,000, Jim
and those who want less than $1,000 vote for Jim’s choice. In both cases, Jim’s
choice of $1,000 wins 

> **Preferred levels of expenditure on public goods**

Lucy | Tom | Jim  | John | Jill
---- | --- | ---  | ---- | ----
600  | 800 | 1000 | 1200 | 1400

#### The inefficiency of the majority voting equilibrium

Because the median voter determines the level of expenditure on public goods, we
only need to examine how the median voter cotes.For a wide variety of public
goods, with proportional or progressive taxation majority voting will result in
oversupply.

![Figure A](https://i.ibb.co/K20yjy3/95A.png)

If income distribution is symmetric (Fig. 9.5. A), the average income will be
equal to the income of the median individual.

![Figure B](https://i.ibb.co/zrJqHZd/95B.png)

However income distribution is usually skewed (Fig. 9.5B). As individuals with
lower income prefer more public goods, oversupply is likely to occur.

#### The two party system and the median Voter

Trying to answer how politicians vote, a natural supposition is that they wish
to stay in office and follow a vote maximizing strategy. Assume that there are
two parties R and D. Party R takes the position of the party D on an issue, say
public expenditure, as given. Party R chooses position GR and between the median
voter’s choice Gm and GD to win the majority. Then party D chooses position
$G_D$ between Gm and GD to win the majority. Then party R can move to $G_R$
between Gm and $G_D$ to win and so on. Eventually both parties will converge at
Gm.

> If theres a two party system, they tend to the median option. **IT's abput
> convergence experienced by two polarised parties.**

### Limitations of the median voter theorem

There may not be a majority voting equilibrium (non single –peaked
preferences).Some people are liberal in some issues and conservatives in others,
thus median voter is not well defined. Being informed and voting is associated
with  costs (e.g. in time). The voters whose preferences are near the median
voter have little  incentive to be politically active and vote if they believe
that the political  process will reflect their preferences anyway.There is
greater tendency for political  activism at the extremes of the political
spectrum, which may partially offset the median-directed tendencies. 

## Politics and Economics

> An economic interpretation of political phenomena

### Why do individuals vote?

In many elections participation rates are low and sensitive to chance
occurrences as changes in the weather. The reason for this is that benefits of
voting for the individual are low. There is little  chance that one person will
affect the outcome. Moreover, the alternatives may differ so little  that the
outcome is inconsequential. However, although in a fully rational calculation,
no one would vote as the chance of affecting the outcome (who wins –not by how
much) is essentially zero, individuals do vote. The paradox is resolved by
assigning utility to voting itself and participating in the political process.
This also implies that voters may not act in the narrow self interested manner
we have previously assumed.
