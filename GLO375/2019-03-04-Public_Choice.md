## Public vs Private choice

There is a question of the magnitude of public provision of public and private
goods. Market economy uses the price mechanism to reach an effective resource
allocation. Decisions about resource allocation in the public sectors are
different. Individuals vote for representatives and these elected
representatives in turn, vote for a public budget and money is spent by a
variety of administrative agencies.

### The problem preference revelations

Individuals express their desirability of one private good versus another by
simple action, buying. Elections of public officials convey only limited
information about voters attitudes towards specific public goods. At best, they
convey a general notion that voters prefer more or less government spending.

For example, polls show how strong sentiment against deficits, however
inconsistent picture emerges regarding the trade-offs. Some polls suggest that
voters would be willing to pay higher taxes and accept expenditure cuts, while
others don't. Unless faced with concrete trade-offs it is hard to get voters
think seriously about their choices.

In private decisions, the decision maker knows their own preferences. Where as
in public decision, the decision maker must ascertain the preferences of those
on whose behalf they are making the decision.

### Hidden preferences

Even if individuals were asked directly about their preferences the may hide
their true preferences: 

- If what they have to pay does not depend on their answer, people tend to
mand for more. People demand more of something they don’t have to pay for. 
- If what they have to pay does depend on their answer, people have an incentive
  to pretend that they enjoy the good much less than they really do. They know
  that their individual answer will have a negligible effect on the total amount
  supplied, and they would like to be free riders.

### Individual preference for public goods

Different individuals have different views on how much should be spent on public
goods or publicly provided private goods. Theocharis PapadopoulosThey differ for
three main reasons: 

1. Differences in tastes 
2. Income
3. Taxation 

Just as some people prefer one ice cream flavour over another. Similarly some
individuals prefer public parks and national defence, whereas others prefer
private goods such as restaurant dinners and cars. 

### Income and taxation effect on preference for public goods

The other two sources of differences in preference are income and
taxation. Individuals with higher income would normally like to consume more od
all goods, public and private. However their preference will be affected by the
price they are asked to pay. For private goods rich and poor pay the same
price. Regarding public goods, richer individuals usually face a higher price,
as they often contribute more to the additional taxes required to finance public
goods. The *tax price* is the additional amount an individual must pay when
government expenditure increases. If everyone pays the same richer individuals
prefer more public goods.If richer individuals often pay a higher tax price, the
will have a lower preference for public goods, while those at lower incomes will
have a higher preference. 

### The problem of aggregating preferences

In private markets, firms don’t have to balance the interests of one group
against those of another. If an individual is willing to pay a price for a
commodity above the marginal cost, then the firm has incentive to sell it.
Decisions are made on an individual basis. Contrary, in the public sector
decisions are made collectively. Apolitician voting to increase expenditure on a
public good does not spend his/her money. Politician is meant to represent
his/her constituents, but their opinions are not unanimous. Some might like more
military spending, other less. The problem of reconciling differences arises
whenever collective decision making is required. In a dictatorship, the answer
is easy: the dictator’s preferences dominate. However, things are more
complicated in democracy. 

## Voting Problems

> Majority voting and paradoxes

### Majority Voting

Simple majority voting is one of the most commonly used rules in democracy.
Suppose three individuals have to choose between spending on national defense
and education. They ask a vote and if two of them for education, that's where
the money is spent.

### The voting paradox (cyclical voting paradox)

However, things become more complex when dealing with multituted of options. For
example, allocating money to: defense, healthcare and education.
