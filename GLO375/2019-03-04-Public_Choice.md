## Public vs Private choice

There is a question of the magnitude of public provision of public and private
goods. Market economy uses the price mechanism to reach an effective resource
allocation. Decisions about resource allocation in the public sectors are
different. Individuals vote for representatives and these elected
representatives in turn, vote for a public budget and money is spent by a
variety of administrative agencies.

### The problem preference revelations

Individuals express their desirability of one private good versus another by
simple action, buying. Elections of public officials convey only limited
information about voters attitudes towards specific public goods. At best, they
convey a general notion that voters prefer more or less government spending.

For example, polls show how strong sentiment against deficits, however
inconsistent picture emerges regarding the trade-offs. Some polls suggest that
voters would be willing to pay higher taxes and accept expenditure cuts, while
others don't. Unless faced with concrete trade-offs it is hard to get voters
think seriously about their choices.

In private decisions, the decision maker knows their own preferences. Where as
in public decision, the decision maker must ascertain the preferences of those
on whose behalf they are making the decision.

### Hidden preferences

Even if individuals were asked directly about their preferences the may hide
their true preferences:  

- If what they have to pay does not depend on their answer, people tend to
  demand for more. People demand more of something they donâ€™t have to pay for. 
- If what they have to pay does depend on their answer, people have an incentive
  to pretend that they enjoy the good much less than they really do. They know
  that their individual answer will have a negligible effect on the total amount
  supplied, and they would like to be free riders.
