The product in the picture depict biodegradable drinking straws. 
I actually sell this product, thus the reason for choosing this product over
other responsible products. The product is responsible in the sense, that the
material from which it is made from is bio-degradable and thus does not imply a
negative externality of consumption (and production) due to the absence of
plastics. The biodgradability trend in itself is responsible, but seems even
more so, relative to traditional production methods and materials.
These straws offer just the same user experience as plastic straws, and unlike
paper substitutes, these don't *sog* and disintegrate while drinking. 
An example I would have liked to present is a bio-degradable *plastic bag* that
I sourced from indonesia, which disintegrades slowly in contact with water.
Besides offering the same user experience, it also has advantages tax-wise, in
the sense that there are taxes on single-use plastic products, which don't need
to be paid with this substitute.
