## What is Corporate social responsibility?

> "CSR is a concept whereby companies integrate social and environmental concerns
> in their business operations and in their interaction with their stakeholders on
> a *voluntary* basis."

> CSR is the continuiing commitment by business to behave *ethically* and
> contribute to economic development while improving the quality of life of the
> workforce and their families as well as of the local
> community and society at large.

**CSR is about taking into consideration all the stakeholders**

CSR may be *internal or external*. Internal CSR concerns the internal
environemtn of the business (human resources), where as external CSR is
concerned about the external environemtn of the business (natural environment,
customers, consumers, suppliers and society).

CSR can have a *Compensatory character*, meaning minimising the negative externalitties and
compensation for the total. CSR can also have *charity character*, offering to the
total that is excessive of the damange, if any, caused by the business activity.
