# What is Corporate social responsibility?

> "*CSR* is a concept whereby companies integrate social and environmental concerns
> in their business operations and in their interaction with their stakeholders on
> a *voluntary* basis."

> *CSR* is the continuing commitment by business to behave *ethically* and
> contribute to economic development while improving the quality of life of the
> workforce and their families as well as of the local
> community and society at large.

**CSR is about taking into consideration all the stakeholders**

### Internal Vs. External *CSR* 

*CSR* may be *internal or external*. Internal *CSR* concerns the internal
environment of the business (human resources), where as external *CSR* is
concerned about the external environment of the business (natural environment,
customers, consumers, suppliers and society).

### Compensatory Vs. Charitable character

*CSR* can have a *Compensatory character*, meaning minimising the negative externalities and
compensation for the total. *CSR* can also have *charity character*, offering to the
total that is excessive of the damage, if any, caused by the business activity.

> There is a chicken egg problem observed between profitability and *CSR*.

### Factors favouring *CSR*

Factors favouring *CSR* include the growth of multinational organisations (being
bigger than the GDP of other countries, meaning having a big responsibility)
globalisation, civil society and post-material needs. Civil society means, that
people care for what is happening with the public agenda. 

### Relevancy of *CSR* Today

*CSR* is relevant because one has to differentiate oneself from competitors. *CSR*
helps to develop and enhance relationships with customers, suppliers and
networks and attract, remain and maintain a happy workforce, becoming a
*employer of choice*. *CSR* helps to save money on energy and operating costs and
manage risk, but also generates innovation, learning and enhancing influence. 

**Also *CSR* is relevant because:**

- Save money on energy and operating costs and manage risk
- Generate innovation and learning and enhance your influence
- Get access to investment and funding opportunities
- Improve your business reputation and standing and generate positive publicity
  and media opportunities due to media interest in ethical business activities

### Criticism

#### Criticism from the right

- Corporation's purpose is to maximize returns to its shareholders, commitment
  to *CSR* is a dangerous deviation
- Only people can have social responsibilities, corporations are only
  responsible to their shareholders and not to society as a whole
- Establishing universal behaviour/social standards may be unproductive
- *CSR* is the Trojan Horse of the anti-capitalist NGOs

#### Criticism from the left

- Corporations start *CSR* programs for the commercial benefit they enjoy through
  raising their reputation with the public or with government
- *CSR* helps to *greenwash* the company's image, to cover up negative impacts by
  saturating the media with positive images of the company's *CSR* credentials
- Companies claim to promote *CSR* and be committed to sustainable development
  while engaging in harmful business practices

#### More concerns

- Capture and retreat of the state 
- Privatization of public interest 
- Democratic deficit 
- Focus on *CSR* will delay or discourage more effective measures to enhance
  social welfare 
- As society looks to companies to address these problems, the real solutions
  may be ignored 
- Charities often target symptoms, not causes

### Answering the criticism

There is no trade-off between CSR and long-term economice efficiency and
profitability. CSR practices often promote stricter regulation and are not
necessarily an impediment to regulation. Every voluntary action with a positive
impact, even if it's not an optimum choice, contributes to a better world.

> are forcing us to do it…” [but] “because it is good for our business”
