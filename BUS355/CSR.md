## What is Corporate social responsibility?

> "CSR is a concept whereby companies integrate social and environmental concerns
> in their business operations and in their interaction with their stakeholders on
> a *voluntary* basis."

> CSR is the continuiing commitment by business to behave *ethically* and
> contribute to economic development while improving the quality of life of the
> workforce and their families as well as of the local
> community and society at large.

**CSR is about taking into consideration all the stakeholders**

CSR may be *internal or external*. Internal CSR concerns the internal
environemtn of the business (human resources), where as external CSR is
concerned about the external environemtn of the business (natural environment,
customers, consumers, suppliers and society).

CSR can have a *Compensatory character*, meaning minimising the negative externalitties and
compensation for the total. CSR can also have *charity character*, offering to the
total that is excessive of the damange, if any, caused by the business activity.

> There is a chicken egg problem observed between profitability and CSR.

Factors favouring CSR include the growth of multinational organisations (being
bigger than the GDP of other countries, meaning having a big responsibility)
globalisation, civil society and post-material needs. Civil society means, that
people care for what is happening with the public agenda. 

CSR is relevant because one has to differentiate oneself from competitors. CSR
helps to develop and enhance relationships with customers, suppliers and
networks and attract, remain and maintain a happy workforce, becoming a
*employer of choice*. CSR helps to save money on energy and operating costs and
manage risk, but also generates innovation, learning and enhancing influence. 

**Also CSR is relevant because:**

- Save money on energy and operating costs and manage risk
- Generate innovation and learning and enhance your influence
- Get access to investment and funding opportunities
- Improve your business reputation and standing and generate positive publicity
  and media opportunities due to media interest in ethical business activities

### Criticism

#### Criticism from the right

- Corporation's purpose is to maximize returns to its shareholders, commitment
  to CSR is a dangerous deviation
- Only people can have social responsibilities, corporations are only
  responsible to their shareholders and not to society as a whole
- Establishing universal standards may be unproductive
- CSR is the Trojan Horse of the anti-capitalist NGOs

#### Criticism from the left

- Corporations start CSR programs for the commercial benefit they enjoy through
  raising their reputation with the public or with government
- CSR helps to greenwash the company's image, to cover up negative impacts by
  saturating the media with positive images of the company's CSR credentials
- Companies claim to promote CSR and be committed to sustainable development
  while engaging in harmful business practices

#### More concerns

- Capture and retreat of the state 
- Privatization of public interest 
- Democratic deficit 
- Focus on CSR will delay or discourage more effective measures to enhance
  social welfare 
- As society looks to companies to address these problems, the real solutions
  may be ignored 
- Charities often target symptoms, not causes
