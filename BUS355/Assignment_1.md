## Questions

1. How would you describe the leadership style of Steve Jobs as depicted in the
   film? Use examples.
2. Aaron Sorkin has been accused for unfairly depicting Jobs in a bad light. Do
   some research and write your opinion on that? Is there a problem if thatâ€™s
   true or it is acceptable artistic freedom?
3. Steve Jobs was forced out of the company he co-founded. Was he a victim or
   did he have responsibility for that?

## Notes

1. He's autocratic, commanding, non-sensible for in-house recommendations et
   cetera.

2. My opinion is, that Steve was probably worse in the movie, especially with
   dramatic effects added to the scenery to make the experience of the movie
   have bigger of an influence on the audience watching. It is absolutely no
   problem and is completely acceptable as artistic freedom. The limits of
   artistic freedom start where they interfere with the freedom of societal
   entities. The movie didn't need a look-alike like *Ashton Kutcher* in the
   2013 version of the movie, but an authentic and really good actor to bring
   across the dramatically evolving story. Even the depiction, let it be worse
   than he actually was in real life, is acceptable as artistic freedom, as
   aspects sometimes need to be hyperbolically expressed to be distinct enough
   for everyone in the audience to pick up.

3. The board would say he is responsible for his actions and thus the removal of
   Steve was logically supported. From Steve's point of view, he was forced out
   of the thing he created and envisioned, which doesn't seem fair. The matter
   of the fact is, that it depends whom you ask and whether they see Steve as a
   victim in his role or not. Ultimately, he came back to the company, as a
   different man one could say and thus it could be said that even though he may
   have been forced out logically backed and sensible at the time, apple needed
   jobs.


## Executive Summary

This Report is intended to function as an analysis of the *Steve Jobs (2015)*
movie under consideration of Jobs's, notoriously known, leadership style and the
depiction in movie in contrast to reality. This report also looks at the
timespan in which Jobs was *forced* out of *Apple* and later on reinstated. 

The movie, as all movies are made to be pleasing towards a certain audience and
thus has made changes to how certain events went down or how a character is
depicted. The artistic freedom is an important freedom to wield when adapting a
movie to be more pleasing for commercial reasons, making the movie more
interesting for watchers. 

## Jobs's Leadership Style

Steve's Leadership style was lacking any glimpse of politeness or gentleness. He
treated his employees in a verbally rough manner and didn't restrain his
impulsiveness nearby. Jobs pushed his people to do better and work harder,
which he is also often being praised for. The fact that his leadership style
dramatically changed after the point of his returning, wasn't particularly
*outstanding* to the watcher. Before leaving Apple, his leadership style was
commanding with an autocratic undertone. He was impulsive and didn't hesitate to
publicly express his anger nearby or directed towards employees. Employees were
intimidated by him and feared the consequence of failure. Jobs himself saw his
leadership style as more motivational in nature than suppressive or abusive. He
famously said that *the people working for him are skilled enough and wanted
enough to go to any big corporation, but rather stay at apple to get amazing
things done*, which emphasises the point of him being motivational instead of
being suppressive. The leadership style in the movie was clearly depicted as
rather suppressive, but considering that the majority of the movie was in fact
within the time period in which Steve was young, immature and impulsive, it
makes sense that there is a major presence of these (young age negatively
attributed) traits in his character and thus his leadership style.

## The depiction of Jobs in the movie in contrast to reality

First of all, choosing *Michael Fassbender* as an actor for the role of Steve
instead of a rather look-alike such as the choice of *Ashton Kutscher* in the
2013 version of the movie, who definitely has much resemblance with the young
Steve, is a rather important choice to make as it accentuates the character and
the well acted performance, as in reality, instead of resembling reality in a
visual form. The question asks whether or not Jobs is being portrayed in a bad
light in the movie and whether that is a problem or artistic freedom. It is
important to say that artistic freedom is limitless as far as limits of other
subjects do not encircle it, meaning that there is only a problem if there is
someone to have a problem in the first place. Artistic freedom is an especially
difficult topic to argue about and becomes nearly impossible when wanting to
declare a scope for it. The question rather could be answered with *whether or
not the movie as a whole needs to be re-labelled to more adequately fit the
depiction of events and character for future watchers with certain expectations
given their knowledge about the real Steve Jobs.* These expectations are
drastically more important when people don't know (the *real*) Steve Jobs, but
maybe his work/achievements and hence have a certain image of Jobs, which could
be demolished by a movie depicting him in an unfairly bad light. To answer
whether or not he is in fact being depicted in an unfairly bad light, the
question of whether or not people that did in fact know Steve Jobs, do clearly
distinguish between the real and as in the movie depicted Steve. *Walt
Mossberg*, an American journalist, most known in the technology
commentary/review scene did know Steve Jobs for over 14 years, interviewed him
several times and *spent scores of hours in private conversation* (Mossberg,
2015). At the time of the release of the movie, he released a column in the
*Mossberg weekly commentary* about his most urging thoughts about what he needed
to address to his audience to prepare them for the movie, in terms of
expectations. 

> In nearly every conversation we had, Steve Jobs bragged about his children and
> asked about mine. When he was battling the disease that killed him too young,
> he took time to ask me about my own health and to admonish me to stop smoking
> cigars. That person doesn't appear in the Sorkin film.
> Steve Jobs wasn't perfect. He was difficult. He was unnecessarily rude and
> brusque at times. He lied. But he also mellowed and grew as a person, and
> that mellowing coincided with the best part of his career. Mr. Sorkin opts
> to hide all of that from his audience. The best of the real Steve Jobs
> begins to unfold just as Steve Jobs ends.
> (Mossberg, 2015)

His commentary was only about Steve's depiction, accentuating his strong
disagreement and concern about the movie. Hence, it can be said that there is an
unfair depiction of Steve in the movie. This unfair depiction is highly
depending on the above mentioned presence of *young steve*, thus the presence of
his early-age impulsiveness and coldness. Thus, the movie had a preprogrammed
domination of Steve's characters over time, which led to the induction of
feeling of wrong depiction of Steve in people that did know Steve, such as
Mossberg. On the other hand, Mossberg may be biased towards Steve, given that
they had a personal relationship and emotional moments. Such can be seen in
following quote from Mossberg:

> In nearly every conversation we had, Steve Jobs bragged about his children and
> asked about mine. When he was battling the disease that killed him too young,
> he took time to ask me about my own health and to admonish me to stop smoking
> cigars. That person doesn't appear in the Sorkin film.
> (Mossberg, 2015)

Mossberg's opinions about this movie coincide with mine, in that the movie had a
focus on the early part of his life, filled with his impulsiveness, rather than
being a balanced, actual representation of Steve. But that is what happens when
one limits the scope of coverage of a movie, parts are being left out, which may
be important for the overall picture, but are not what the movie produces by
intending to show his struggles rather than his experienced and wise character
at the more mature state of his life.

Steve Wozniak, the second most known Apple co-founder, also gave a statement on
the movie after its release, but had seen in pre-production already, thus had a
less spontaneous, but more prepared and developed opinion. His opinion was also
not about whether the movie showed a realistic depiction of the overall Steve.
Rather, knowing that it is only a part of the whole of him in the movie allowed
him to give an opinion about whether or not the actor performed well at
depicting Steve at those particular points in his life and whether or not
*Michael Fassbender* did well with making it easy for the watchers to gain
insights into how he thought. When Wozniak was asked about the particular
aspects of Jobs's personality that are shown well, he answered:

> It deals with what we are all very familiar with - a lot of his negativism.
> [...]
> This comes about less with him doing negative things to other people, and more
> him just sort of standing [there] and not caring as much about others as
> himself, and not being able to have feelings very much.
> [...]
> But when you see it portrayed dramatically, not the way it really happened but
> in a way that is emotionally graphic, it really conveys what Steve Jobs was
> really like inside... And what it was like to be around him.
> (Woz, 2015)

His quotes are obviously with the given acceptance about the fact that the movie
is focusing on his *negativism* and thus centered around the true depiction of
what Steve could be like. 
Considering all said, the question of whether or not the movie is a problem and
is or isn't artistic freedom, depends on who is asked and under what
considerations they are answering. The movie did a great job at portraying the
things that it wanted to portray, necessarily leaving out other parts of his
personality, such as his warmth, compassion which surfaced at the more mature
point of his life. Thus, generally and most objectively said, what should be
done, is to put a big disclaimer in front of the movie or rename the movie to a
more fitting title, adjusting potential watcher's expectations accordingly. If
the movie states clearly what it is going to depict without giving it away,
which cannot be done if the movie's qualities are the performance of the actors,
the movie won't leave room for misunderstandings/inadequate expectations in the
first place.

## Jobs's removal and reinstating Jobs 

Given what has been said above, it is clear that his removal was definitively
character forming and ultimately for the better for him. Him being reinstated
happened twelve years after him leaving, thus the Steve who came back to Apple
was not the one who left in terms of character. The acquisition of *NeXT* was
also quite important in terms of technology for Apple, due to the superior
operating system. Thus, him having been reinstated has more reasons than Sully
wanting Steve back. 
Whether or not he was a victim or it was fair to remove him, depends on what one
see's in his role. Steve is a very similar CEO to Elon Musk, thus their
*specialities* when it comes to running their firm. They aren't CEO's in the
traditional sense, but inspiring leaders that have a vision they want to see
reality and want everyone else to see. Were he CEO instead of Sully, he wouldn't
have been removed, but maybe would have been in similar troubles on the
forefront of innovation of operating systems, which was the particular reason
for the end of Sully's CEO position.
Steve was rightfully removed, in that he, in his position was wrong and did
actually step outside of his borders within the team/company. Sully was
responsible for the well-running of the company, including harnessing the
incredible energy of Jobs, which he as known occasionally exerts negatively.
Henceforth, Sully had the responsibility of ultimately removing Steve from the
team. Did He only know to let Steve have his on space to let him do things on
his own without anyone interfering until finished.
