## Questions

1. How would you describe the leadership style of Steve Jobs as depicted in the
   film? Use examples.
2. Aaron Sorkin has been accused for unfairly depicting Jobs in a bad light. Do
   some research and write your opinion on that? Is there a problem if thatâ€™s
   true or it is acceptable artistic freedom?
3. Steve Jobs was forced out of the company he co-founded. Was he a victim or
   did he have responsibility for that?

## Notes

1. He's autocratic, commanding, non-sensible for in-house recommendations et
   cetera.

2. My opinion is, that Steve was probably worse in the movie, especially with
   dramatic effects added to the scenery to make the experience of the movie
   have bigger of an influence on the audience watching. It is absolutely no
   problem and is completely acceptable as artistic freedom. The limits of
   artisitic freedom start where they interfere with the freedom of societal
   entities. The movie didn't need a look-alike like *Ashton Kutcher* in the
   2013 version of the movie, but an authentic and really good actor to bring
   across the dramatically evolving story. Even the depicition, let it be worse
   than he actually was in real life, is acceptable as artistic freedom, as
   aspects sometimes need to be hyperbolically expressed to be distinct enough
   for everyone in the audience to pick up.

3. The board would say he is responsible for his actions and thus the removal of
   steve was logically supported. From Steve's point of view, he was forced out
   of the thing he created and envisioned, which doesn't seem fair. The matter
   of the fact is, that it depends whom you ask and whether they see steve as a
   victim in his role or not. Ultimately, he came back to the company, as a
   different man one could say and thus it could be said that even though he may
   have been forced out logically backed and sensible at the time, apple needed
   jobs.
