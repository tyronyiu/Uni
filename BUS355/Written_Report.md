### Executive Summary:

A summary including information on what this report has achieved in doing.

### Table of Contents:

Each section included in the report should be listed and given its own numbering, which is in turn reflected in the report itself.

### Introduction:

**In this section I would expect the best students to:**
Discuss what we mean by change management.
Consider why an understanding of change management is highly important.
Explain any relevant theories/models in relation to the wider topic of change management.
Signpost the structure of the document, including a brief overview of the company they have chosen.

### Main Body:

In this section I would expect students to discuss the changes that the organisation they have chosen had to deal with.  A clear analysis should be provided in relation to what was the change, what was the impact it had on the organisation and how did they deal with it. 

The main purpose for performing this secondary research is to allow students to practically see the effect that changes can have on business organisations. That way they can understand that such changes can be positive or negative, direct or indirect.  It is crucial for students to show case the risks of having to deal with change and the power/influence of relevant stakeholders to each case scenario.

### Conclusions:

This section should summarise the main points of the previous section, drawing everything together.

### Recommendations:

Any recommendations might take the form of advice to managers attempting to understand the business environment.

### List of References:

References need to be provided in an alphabetical order.
