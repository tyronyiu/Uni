Children can be influenced by their toys because of an underlying emotional
bonding with them, such as self-identification. The *tokidoki* Tattoo Barbie is
targeted towards adults as a collector’s piece. Therefore, the doll should not
have an influence on children in the direct sense as being sold to them and
creating emotional bonding. Thus, there is no reasons for parents to fear of
having their children negatively affected by the *tokidoki* doll. The fact that
they still do, proves the importance of marketing and product placement for a
company such as *“Mattel”*. The recently in popularity rising company *“juul”*
has experienced a very similar situation, in which their to adults targeted
product was sold to teenagers. This has stigmatised the rationality of the
company just like with *“Mattel”*. Their product should have never been in young
hands in the first place, just like *tokidoki*. Henceforth, the *“Mattel”*
company should follow similar procedures to *“Juul”*, where they expanded
control over sales of their product.
