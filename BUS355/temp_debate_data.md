Mattel should not have created tokidoki Tattoo Barbie because the doll sends the
wrong message about fashion and tattoos to impressionable children.

It is important that impressionable children are within an environment that is
appropriate. The effects of inappropriate environments are as known
traumatising. The general perception of parents is most important for a company
that produces children toys, as the toys impact the lives of the children during
the time of possession and parents therefore wish for these influential toys to
be appropriate, pedagogic advancing et cetera. A doll with tattoos and the shown
clothing is not seen as such in the public perception.
