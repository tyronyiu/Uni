Culture being how we do things in the context of having shared values and goals
that are replacing formal structures.

Reducing formal managing structures such as hierarchies, can be achieved by e.g.
utilising *holocracy*.

Zappos - Shoe online shop and their extraordinary customer service values
integrated into their organisational culture. "Customer satisfaction can only be
ensured when having employee satisfaction first." (Tony hsieh)

### Four types of organisational culture

```
Clan - Adhocracy - Hierarchy - Market
family - doing things first - getting the job done - doing things right
```

### Levels of organisational culture

And primary ways to discover organisation culture

The basic underlying behaviouristics are classified as the first level of
organisation culture distinction. The second level of such would be the values
and core beliefs they hold dear and communicate. The third and final level, the
tip of the pyramid, is the obvious, apparent surfaced cultural aspects such
as can be seen in the offices of Zappos. Those apparent cultural feats/treats
are in fact the least important, basic ones.
