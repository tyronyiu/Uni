A tattoo is a tattoo, nevertheless what it depicts, the reasons for getting it
or if a person on tv or a Barbie has it. It is incredibly important for children
to understand the nature of something, especially like a tattoo. The
responsibility for understanding that and consequences like permanency, lies
with the parents of the child, not a company producing a product targeted to
adult collectors.  

Children that are influenced by something, have to be receptive to be
influence-able. Henceforth, if any effect were to be made upon a child, reason
is that child’s receptiveness, not the specifics of that something. Otherwise,
an endless list of specifics were have to be conducted for non-display, due to
receptiveness of children towards them.




Children can be influenced by their toys because of an underlying emotional
bonding with them, such as self-identification. The *tokidoki* Tattoo Barbie is
targeted towards adults as a collector’s piece. Therefore, the doll should not
have an influence on children in the direct sense as being sold to them and
creating emotional bonding. Thus, there is no reasons for parents to fear of
having their children negatively affected by the *tokidoki* doll. The fact that
they still do, proves the importance of marketing and product placement for a
company such as *“Mattel”*. The recently in popularity rising company *“juul”*
has experienced a very similar situation, in which their to adults targeted
product was sold to teenagers. This has stigmatised the rationality of the
company just like with *“Mattel”*. Their product should have never been in young
hands in the first place, just like *tokidoki*. Henceforth, the *“Mattel”*
company should follow similar procedures to *“Juul”*, where they expanded
control over sales of their product.
