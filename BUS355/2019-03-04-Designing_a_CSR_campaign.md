### Business-based social purpose

Finding a business-based social purpose for the business in question, such as
hunger, discrimination et cetera. Leadership-level CSR programs always directly
reflect what the business is and what it does.

### Clear theory of change

CSR is becoming ubiquitous, much more homogenous. The CSR leaders develop
proprietary approaches to drive measurable social change.

### Quality and depth of information

Identificaiton of social priorities for community investment is not enough,
leadership comes from providing employees, customers, external stakeholders a
depth of information about the social issue. Such an example would be [IBM

### Concentrated effort

Diversification of social issues to support leads to diminished effectiveness of
said support. Leadership is shown by corporations that focus their efforts on
one social issue and align all their internal and external resources with this
issue. Such could be [The Costa Foundation](www.costafoundation.com)

### Partnering with experts

Leadership requires high credibility. The short option would be through
relations with social issue experts and non-profit organisations. Such could be

### Self-interest as the main objective

If there were no positive self-interest in implementing CSR measures, companies
would not do so. A good example of matching would be *what's in it for me?* vs.
*what's in it for them?*

### Prioritisation

Relevance for the business in question must be met. Identify naturally supported
interests. Such would be the value of the interest to society as a large, the
value to the stakeholders and/or the value of the affected stakeholders to your
business (extent of ability of interfering/supporting the business operations)
Working from highest priority of both, negative and positive impacts and seek
opportunities to accentuate the postive and mitigate the negative.
