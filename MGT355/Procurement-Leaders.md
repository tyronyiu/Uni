## Procurement Leaders 
- Naomi Kennedy (Strategy & Operations Director) 
- Alex Franklin (People advisor)

### Procurement
> Building a supply chain by considering acquisition of resources.

Since much of procurement can be done via automation, utilising AI to compare
and analyse costs and finding an effective/efficient supply chain, procurement
trends to become more of supply chain management and being concerned with adding
value to the product/service instead of reducing/optimising cost.

### Trends impacting procurement
- Agility
    - SCRUM methodology
    - Category management structure
    - Organisational structure
- Talent
- Digitisation
    - Shorten go-to-market period
    - Increased supply chain transparency
- Artificial Intelligence
    - Structuring data
- *Blockchain*
- Automation

#### Agile Leadership
Requiring the team empowerment, the boldness for course correction, management
of change, risk and reward balancing and having a clear vision of the objectives
to achieve. Above mentioned frameworks help doing that.

#### Artificial Intelligence
Business will place an emphasis on procurement's ability to use data and
identify and respond to more complex motions of supply chain risk.

### Accelerating Procurement transformation
Reactive Procurement (84% of functions) (Support function) VS. Proactive
Procurement (16% of functions) (Business Partner). 

- Price management
- cost management
- Total cost of ownership (Supplier collaboration)
- Value creation (network coordination)

Acceleration can be achieved by Research & Insights, Tools/advisory and
leveraging the network built.

#### Case: Coca Cola
The *Coca Cola* cans feature names, which are printed on the cans. This value
addition is not a cost reduction, but has a greater outcome, thus in
retro-perspective it was a great strategy to choose that supplier, wanting to
print individual's names on the cans.

### North American agriculture company
> The current member is a result of a merger in 2018, where one of the companies
> was a PL member since 2015. The newly formed company utilised their membership
> to support in merging both company's existing procurement processes, creating
> the *new way*.

The two companies have different operations and thus different considerations to
be taken, extending into procurement. SWOT analysis could be use to aid the
process of defining the new procurement process. Also the integration of
Procurement and the maturity of the procurement processes are very important for
merging the two company's strategies.

The outside perspective the other company brings can be useful, as well as the
already existing resources that can be leveraged, also there may be converging
stakeholder's interests. 

PL listed the twenty key processes as rated by Power Users and the themes hat
needed outside perspective. Then they created an M&A playbook, matching
available resources with the topics of interest (key processes and those needing
overhauls). PL connected another member from their network with the two merging
companies, gaining perspectives and possible solutions to similar challenges.
