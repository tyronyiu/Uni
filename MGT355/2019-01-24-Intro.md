# Glossary

**Fixed Position Layout**
: Moving the material around the labour, instead of the opposite, to minimise
motion.

**Operations Management**
: The activity of Managing the resources devoted to the production & delivery of
products and services.

**Pure Products/services**
: Outputs that are exclusively tangible/intangible

**Mixture of Products & Services**
: Mixture of tangible/intangible


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operations Management is one of the three functions, Marketing, Finance and
Operations of any organisation. We want to know how goods/services are produced.
It needs to be known what operations managers do. Departments such as Marketing,
HR or Finance rely on Operations, as it provides necessary building blocks,
products/services. Because of the actual producing the product taking place
within the Operations Department, it is often the most costly Department.
Operations in consideration to contribution should be looked at in comparison to
an increase in sales or decrease in finance. Quality Management and
Service/Product design are critical decisions of Operations Management. 

## The Critical Decisions

Process and capacity design as well as Location, in terms of what processes
willo products require, what equipment/technology is necessary? The Layout needs
to be designed, how should it be arranged from inside? Supply Chain Management &
Material planning (OVERHAUL)

## OM Jobs

- Plant Management
- Purchasing Director
- Supply Chain Management

## Heritage of Operations Management

*La cherché pour l'optimisatio continuelle*. **Eli Whitney** landed a 10,000
musket contract with the Government in 1798. He showed that machine tools could
make standardised parts to exact specifications. The standardisation that came
with Whitney allowed for more accurate planning and interchangeable parts to be
substituted, thus making warfare less of a guessing game in terms of where
musket rounds go, but more of a planning process in which bullets would travel.
**Frederick W. Taylor**, known as *the father of Scientific Management*, was
chief engineer at Midvale Steel, 1881, and studied how tasks were done. He was
the first to use motion & time studies and further created efficiency
principles. His drive to perceive his observations from a scientific standpoint,
allowed him to observe tasks, split them into actions (motions over time) and
chained these actions to find out whether or not they can be made more
efficient. Prior to Taylor, employees worked as they wanted to, now they had to
follow principles, get training and use specific tools in order for efficiency
increases. 

> In the past the man has been first; in the future the system must be first,
> the first object of any good system must be that of developing first class
> men. -*Frederik W. Taylor*

Taylor's work was continued by Fran & Lillian Gilbreth, an engineering couple
that applied efficiency methods to their home operations and their twelve
children for systematic management.

*The quest of the One Best Way* Motion&Fatigue 

Henry Ford, first used moving assembly line to make the model T car under The
Ford Motor Company 1913. The unfinished product would move by a conveyor belt
past the working station, to minimise motion of labour, thus inventing *fixed
position layout*. Furthermore, by minimising motion, he maximises productivity,
lower cost, effectively lowering price, making it more accessible to the
general public, shifting it from luxury good to normal. The *Organisation:
Labour Control* is a cooperative project between Taylor and Ford. Taylorism for
the Ford employees meant dividing the process up into repetitive tasks, hundrets
for a car. He could, by having more profits, give out more pay, which kept the
employees at the cruel repetitive jobs and attracted even more to Detroid.
Taylorism became a notorious term, due to the perception of the assembly line
system to employees.

**W. Edwards Deming** Engineer and physicist, credited with teaching Japan
quality control methods post WWII. He used statistics to analyse processes and
let workers have involvement in the decisions about the process. His influence
is still worhsipped every year in Japan with the Deming award for innovative
process.

## The Basic transformation Model 

![Essentials of Operations Management Model](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/chapter01essentialsfinal-161006120854/95/chapter-01-essentials-final-4-638.jpg?cb=1475755804)

**Transformed resources** enter the production as something but exits it
*transformed*, differently. **Transforming resources** are the facilities or
staff that transform resources. These *input resources* in Operations
Management undergo the functions of such, *direct, develop, deliver and
design*. The output products and services are then passed on to the customer.
E.g. University: students are the transformed resources, where the professor and
aiding material such as beamer or computer are the transforming resources.

> Consultancy service markets have their biggest share in OM

![Operations Management at IKEA](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/chapter01essentialsfinal-161006120854/95/chapter-01-essentials-final-6-638.jpg?cb=1475755804)

Look at Operations Management at IKEA, the cost lowering achieved by having
customers build their own furniture, not only saves money, but also enables
other firms to use the training received indirectly from IKEA. An Air-Hunter,
designed the packaging of IKEA's *flat-packed* furniture, effectively maximising
used space. The flat-packaging also allowed customers to carry a whole Cabinet.

Pret-á-Manger has its standardisation embodied in staff versatility and value
mixture. Their in-store food preparation saves logistics, while encompassing
more complex labour. The supply chain is more transparent for the end-consumer.
The flexibility that arises from such behaviour, allows Pret to change their
Sandwich assortment within shortest time periods, due to trained staff to be
versatile.

![Prêt-a-Manger](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/chapter01essentialsfinal-161006120854/95/chapter-01-essentials-final-10-638.jpg?cb=1475755804)

![The Basic Function at
Pret](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/chapter01essentialsfinal-161006120854/95/chapter-01-essentials-final-11-638.jpg?cb=1475755804)

## Products & Services within Operations

Most operations produce products and services, there are **pure products** and
**pure services** and the mixture of both. The following depicts a
product/service scale sorted list of Outputs.

- Crude Oil production - Only the oil is delivered
- Aluminium smelting - The aluminium has to be smelted in specification
- Specialist machine tool production - Usage must be taught
- Restaurant - There are significant service as well as product aspects.
- Psychologist Therapy - Purely intangible

## Operations can be analysed on three levels

The flow between operations is the **supply network** also known as the *Supply
Chain*. It is the first level and is concerned with the flow of transformed
resources between operations & processes. The second level is the level of
*operation*, in which the flow between processes take place, such as cutting,
painting, packaging. External operations interact with the internal processes to
form the external supply network. The third level is the level of *process*, in
which there is a flow between resources. Processes form an internal *supply
network* and become each others customers and suppliers.

> Operations Management is concerned with the flow of transformed
> resources between operations & processes, where External operations interact
> with the internal processes to form the external supply network. Processes
> form an internal *supply network* and become each others customers and
> suppliers.

All functions use processes to provide service. Every part of the organisation
uses processes to produce products or services for external customers.


**INSERT MISSING NOTES HERE**

## What is strategy?

Setting broad objectives that direct an enterprise towards its overall goal.
Planning the path that will achieve these goals Dealing with the total picture
rather than stressing individual activities.

## Operations is not the same as operational.

Operations are the resources that create products and services, which is very
similar to strategic.  Operational is the opposite of strategic, meaning
day-to-day and detailed.

## The Four V's

**Volume**, how much output we produce. The higher the volume, the lower the
periodic cost. More processes specialisation and economies of scale are the
reason for the lower periodic cost. **Variety** is about how many different
products/services we offer. The higher the variety, the higher the periodic
cost. In order to produce different products simultaneously, we need more
equipment et cetera. **Variation** in demand. The higher the variation in
demand, the higher the periodic cost. **Visibility**, how much the operation is
visible to the customer or how much customer conduct there is. The higher the
visibility, the higher the periodic cost as e.g. staff needs to be trained for
better customer interactions or the decorations of the facilities.


### Cost leadership & Differentiation

Porter presented two methods / functions, cost leadership and differentiation.
In Cost leadership, the competitive advantage comes from having the lowest
production cost for a product/service. In differentiation the objective is to
convince the customer that your product/service is different/special. It is less
about being better, more about being different. Targeting a niche in the market,
would be focused, opposite from differentiation. 

## How is operations strategy different to operations management?

Operations management is short term focused, on the micro scale, concrete and
detailed (*"Can we give tax services to the small business market in antwerp?"*)
where as operations strategy is long term, on the macro scale, philosophical and
aggregated (*"What is our overall business capabilities compared  with other
capabilities?"*). 

## The 4 stage model of operations contribution

![The 4 stage model of operations contribution
](https://i.ibb.co/RhgdnK3/4-stage-model-of-operations-contribution.png)

From the four stage model it can be seen how *IKEA* or *Pret's* operations
support the strategies they implemented. *Dacia* for example could be in the
second stage or the third stage, given they are a company with several years of
strategy development and integration. First stage companies are normally unknown
and to give example of these are rare, a shop down the street may be stage one.
Stage one companies don't make it and thus they are not growing big enough in
the first place to be known by anyone. Most operating companies are stage two,
where as stage three companies are the best in the market of what they're doing.
If supportive of a fourth stage existing, fourth stage companies redefine
industry expectations and strategy is driving operations. An example could be
*Apple*, that build the *iphone* because it could, not because it planned to.
The capability to engineer the *iphone* was the driving force. The further up
the stage, the increasing is the contribution of operations and the operations
capabilities. Another example for stage four, redefining the industries they
operate in, could be *Amazon*, which was not good at being a book store, as it
started out, but became so much more, a company good at distribution and
logistics, AI and content delivery networking, they provide an online
marketplace and connect sellers and buyers, deliver food with fresh and even
open their own super markets. Amazon's strategy is to utilise what they are good
at, providing dependable services, such as their delivery services (prime,
supplier delivery).

## The four perspectives on operations strategy

![The four perspectives on operations strategy
](https://i.ibb.co/FH2mHNg/four-perspectives-of-operations-strategy.png)

*Top - down perspective* describes how operations are being commanded what to do
by the business. *Bottom - up perspective* means improving on experience,
knowing what product/service does well and focusing on that. E.g. Being a
restaurant in which people often ask for take-away, should consider offering
take-away service.  *Market requirement perspective* describes that the e.g.
product choice is depending on the market the firm is in. *Operations resources
perspective* means that the operations will reduce what they cannot do and focus
on what the business can do. E.g. A restaurant in which the customer orders
something, the approach of doing what the client wants would be *market
requirement perspective*, where as when the meal is prepared and chosen by the
cook, it would be a *operations resources perspective*. E.g. Apple telling
customers what they want and need in a product, as they often do is an
*operations resources perspective*.

## Top - Down Bottom - Up perspectives of strategy

![Top - Down Bottom - Up perspectives of strategy
](https://i.ibb.co/W392h4K/topdownbottomupstrategy.png)

## The strategy hierarchy

![The strategy hierarchy](https://i.ibb.co/s1TQkj3/strategy-hierarchy.png)

In the Corporate strategy creation, PESTEL is probably a good method framework.
For Business strategy formation, Porter's five forces could be used. For
Functional strategy formation SWOT is the most fitting tool.  

## Order-winning

Qualifying and less important competitive factors

![Order-winning Factors](https://i.ibb.co/sCphsdD/order-winning1.png)

As I improve my performance competitive benefit increases.

![Qualifying Factors](https://i.ibb.co/6vLPvT6/order-winning2.png")

E.g. Safety for a car is a qualifying factor. Further improvements in
performance will result in diminished competitive benefit. The qualifying
threshold has to be met, but exceeding does not improve competitive benefit.
E.g. earning five safety stars makes a big difference to one star, but having
ten stars (*imaginary*) won't help. A Hotel not changing the bed sheets will not
qualify, thus have a minimal competitive benefit, though changing the sheets
more than ten times a day will not be necessary.

![Less important factors](https://i.ibb.co/xzk4rxz/order-winning3.png)

E.g. A university and the cantine inside or the car having a heated steering
wheel. These factors are not vital and have diminished impact on competitive
benefit overall.

## The effects of the product/service life cycle

![The effects of the product/service life cycle](https://i.ibb.co/zZj237S/product-life-cycle.png)

![The effects of the product/service life cycle cont.
](https://i.ibb.co/zHNQCJf/product-life-cycle1.png)

It can be seen in the figures above, how the different stages of the product
life have different objectives to fulfill. We look at different aspects, given
what stage the product/service is in. E.g. int he growth stage we look at the
availability and quality of the product/service to fulfill the expectation of
the product to the mass market.

## Different competitive factors imply different performance objectives

![Different competitive factors imply different performance objectives
](https://i.ibb.co/W5szk4X/performance-objectives.png)

If the customer asks for low price, the objective should be to reduce cost,
where as if the customer demands high-quality, that's what they should be given.
E.g. Apple providing innovative products and services, what the customers want,
by being flexible. Flexibility allows different thought processes to occur, thus
enabling innovation to happen more likely.

### Strategic Reconciliation

![Strategic Reconciliation](https://i.ibb.co/NTPGRNZ/strategic-reconciliation.png)

## *Mintzberg's* concept of emergent strategy

![Mintzberg's concept of emergent strategy
](https://i.ibb.co/PQxvzqJ/Mintzberg-s-concept-of-emergent-strategy.png)

## The triple bottom line

![The triple bottom line](https://i.ibb.co/HdC67n4/triple-bottom-line.png)

E.g. When choosing plastics for packaging, there is a negative impact upon the
environment, accounted for in the *Planet* aspect of the triple bottom line.
Recycleability of materials, energy, consumption, waste material generation and
the reduction of transport-related energy as well as noise pollution, fume and
emission pollution count towards the *Planet*. Obsolescence and wastage,
Environmental impact of process failures and Recovery to minimise impact of
failures. The *People* aspect includes customer safety from products and
services, employment impact of an operation's location, employment implications
of outsourcing, the repetitive or alienating work done and staff safety in the
workplace as well as non-exploitation of developing country suppliers. The
*Profit* aspect includes the cost of producing products and services, the
revenue from the effects of quality, speed, dependability and flexibility as
well as Effectiveness of investment in operations resources or Risk and
resilience of supply count towards *Profit*. Lastly, it is building the
capabilities for the future of the organisation.

## Operations and process management contribution to strategy

![Operations and process management contribution to strategy
](https://i.ibb.co/nsdMq1X/operations-management-contribution-to-strategy.png)

## The five competitive objectives

![Excelling at the five objectives](https://i.ibb.co/b2CNyCY/excelling-at-the-five-objectives.png)

Quality is about being right. Speed is being fast. Dependability is being on
time reliably. Flexibility is being able to change and adapt. Cost is being
productive in terms of resource allocation. Excelling at these objectives can
have internal and external benefits, as seen in the figure above.

![The external and internal benefits](https://i.ibb.co/p2Hn41W/external-internal-benefits.png)

### Two common meanings of *Quality*

Quality can be seen as the *specification* of a product or service in e.g. the
lower *hurst* farm produces organic meat raised exclusively on its own farm.
**OR** Quality can be seen as *conformance* with which the product or service is
produced. E.g. Quick service restaurants such as *Mcdonalds* may buy less
expensive meat, but its conformance must be high.

### External and internal benefits of conformance quality

![External and internal benefits of conformance quality
](https://i.ibb.co/C213cNG/external-internal-benefits-of-conformance-quality.png)

Irrespective of a product or service's specification quality, producing it so it
conforms to its specification consistently brings benefits to any operation.
**Externally** it enhances the product or service int he market, or at least
avoids customer complaints. **Internally** it brings other benefits to the
operations, such as the prevention of errors slowing down throughput speed,
prevention of errors causing internal unreliability and low dependability or the
prevention of errors causing wasted time and effort, thus saving cost.

### External and internal benefits of speed

![External and internal benefits of speed
](https://i.ibb.co/kD68hh9/external-internal-benefits-of-speed.png)

Speed has different interpretations externally and internally. **Externally** it
means the elapsed time between a customer asking for a product or service and
getting it. (in a satisfactory condition) It often enhances the value of the
product/service. **Internally** it helps to overcome internal problems by
maintaining dependability and reduces the need to manage transformed resources
as they pass through the operation, thus saving cost.

### External and internal benefits of Dependability

![External and internal benefits of Dependability
](https://i.ibb.co/c2SvPVW/external-internal-benefits-of-Dependability.png)

**Externally** it enhances the product or service in the market, or at least
avoids customer complaints. **Internally** it prevents late delivery slowing
down throughput speed and prevents lateness causing disruption and wasted time
and effort thus saving cost.

### External and internal benefits of Flexibility

![External and internal benefits of Flexibility
](https://i.ibb.co/XFZvQcj/external-internal-benefits-of-conformance-flexibility.png)

Refers to an operation's ability to change. 

**Product/service Flexibility**
: The products/services it brings to the market have to be flexible. 

**Mix Flexibility**
: The mix of product/services at any time. 

**Volume Flexibility**
: The volume of products/services the firm produces.

**Delivery Flexibility** 
: The delivery time of its products/services.

### External and internal benefits of performance objectives

![External and internal benefits of performance objectives
](https://i.ibb.co/0KWtm2y/external-internal-benefits-of-performance-objectives.png)

![The external and internal benefits](https://i.ibb.co/p2Hn41W/external-internal-benefits.png)

## Cost

The cost of producing products and services is obviously influences by factors
such as input costs, but two other important sets are: The four V's (volume,
variety, variation, visibility) and *the internal performance of the operation*
at quality, speed, dependability and flexibility.

## Polar Diagrams

![Polar diagrams for a taxi service versus a bus service](https://i.ibb.co/YfdX18j/taxi-bus-polar-diagram.png)

Are used to indicate the relative importance of each performance objective to an
operation or process. They can be used to indicate the difference between
different products and services produced by an operation or process. They can be
seen in e.g. video games, such as *FIFA*, in which polar diagrams are used to
dispay player information (strength/weakness of a particular character feature
such as speed, agility et cetera)

# The design of services and products and processes

The design of products/services and processes are interrelated and should be
treated together.

![](https://i.ibb.co/t3x9Bjv/design-of-product.png)

## Why is design so important?

**UK Design Council Survey**

- Design helps businesses connect strongly with their customers
- 90% of businesses growing rapidly say design is significant to them, only 26%
  of static companies say the same.
- Design reduces costs by making processes more efficient. It can also reduce
  the time to market for new products and services.
- Almost 70 per cent of companies seeing design as integral have developed new
  products and services in the last three years, compared to only a third of
  businesses overall.
- Companies who were ‘effective users of design’ had financial performances 200%
  better than average.

## What is designed in a product or service?

**A Concept**
: the understanding of the nature, use and value of the service or product;

**A Package**
: The group of ‘component’ products and services that provide those benefits
defined in the concept;

**A Process**
: the way in which the component products and services will be created and
delivered.
