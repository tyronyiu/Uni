# Glossary

**Fixed Position Layout**
: Moving the material around the labour, instead of the opposite, to minimise
motion.

**Operations Management**
: The activity of Managing the resources devoted to the production & delivery of
products and services.

**Pure Products/services**
: Outputs that are exclusively tangible/intangible

**Mixture of Products & Services**
: Mixture of tangible/intangible


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operations Management is one of the three functions, Marketing, Finance and
Operations of any organisation. We want to know how goods/services are produced.
It needs to be known what operations managers do. Departments such as Marketing,
HR or Finance rely on Operations, as it provides necessary building blocks,
products/services. Because of the actual producing the product taking place
within the Operations Department, it is often the most costly Department.
Operations in consideration to contribution should be looked at in comparison to
an increase in sales or decrease in finance. Quality Management and
Service/Product design are critical decisions of Operations Management. 

## The Critical Decisions

Process and capacity design as well as Location, in terms of what processes
willo products require, what equipment/technology is necessary? The Layout needs
to be designed, how should it be arranged from inside? Supply Chain Management &
Material planning (OVERHAUL)

## OM Jobs

- Plant Management
- Purchasing Director
- Supply Chain Management

## Heritage of Operations Management

*La cherché pour l'optimisatio continuelle*. **Eli Whitney** landed a 10,000
musket contract with the Government in 1798. He showed that machine tools could
make standardised parts to exact specifications. The standardisation that came
with Whitney allowed for more accurate planning and interchangeable parts to be
substituted, thus making warfare less of a guessing game in terms of where
musket rounds go, but more of a planning process in which bullets would travel.
**Frederick W. Taylor**, known as *the father of Scientific Management*, was
chief engineer at Midvale Steel, 1881, and studied how tasks were done. He was
the first to use motion & time studies and further created efficiency
principles. His drive to perceive his observations from a scientific standpoint,
allowed him to observe tasks, split them into actions (motions over time) and
chained these actions to find out whether or not they can be made more
efficient. Prior to Taylor, employees worked as they wanted to, now they had to
follow principles, get training and use specific tools in order for efficiency
increases. 

> In the past the man has been first; in the future the system must be first,
> the first object of any good system must be that of developing first class
> men. -*Frederik W. Taylor*

Taylor's work was continued by Fran & Lillian Gilbreth, an engineering couple
that applied efficiency methods to their home operations and their twelve
children for systematic management.

*The quest of the One Best Way* Motion&Fatigue 

Henry Ford, first used moving assembly line to make the model T car under The
Ford Motor Company 1913. The unfinished product would move by a conveyor belt
past the working station, to minimise motion of labour, thus inventing *fixed
position layout*. Furthermore, by minimising motion, he maximises productivity,
lower cost, effectively lowering price, making it more accessible to the
general public, shifting it from luxury good to normal. The *Organisation:
Labour Control* is a cooperative project between Taylor and Ford. Taylorism for
the Ford employees meant dividing the process up into repetitive tasks, hundrets
for a car. He could, by having more profits, give out more pay, which kept the
employees at the cruel repetitive jobs and attracted even more to Detroid.
Taylorism became a notorious term, due to the perception of the assembly line
system to employees.

**W. Edwards Deming** Engineer and physicist, credited with teaching Japan
quality control methods post WWII. He used statistics to analyse processes and
let workers have involvement in the decisions about the process. His influence
is still worhsipped every year in Japan with the Deming award for innovative
process.

## The Basic transformation Model 

![Essentials of Operations Management Model](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/chapter01essentialsfinal-161006120854/95/chapter-01-essentials-final-4-638.jpg?cb=1475755804)

**Transformed resources** enter the production as something but exits it
*transformed*, differently. **Transforming resources** are the facilities or
staff that transform resources. These *input resources* in Operations
Management undergo the functions of such, *direct, develop, deliver and
design*. The output products and services are then passed on to the customer.
E.g. University: students are the transformed resources, where the professor and
aiding material such as beamer or computer are the transforming resources.

> Consultancy service markets have their biggest share in OM

Look at Operations Management at IKEA, the cost lowering achieved by having
customers build their own furniture, not only saves money, but also enables
other firms to use the training received indirectly from IKEA. An Air-Hunter,
designed the packaging of IKEA's *flat-packed* furniture, effectively maximising
used space. The flat-packaging also allowed customers to carry a whole Cabinet.

Pret-á-Manger has its standardisation embodied in staff versatility and value
mixture. Their in-store food preparation saves logistics, while encompassing
more complex labour. The supply chain is more transparent for the end-consumer.
The flexibility that arises from such behaviour, allows Pret to change their
Sandwich assortment within shortest time periods, due to trained staff to be
versatile.

## Products & Services within Operations

Most operations produce products and services, there are **pure products** and
**pure services** and the mixture of both. The following depicts a
product/service scale sorted list of Outputs.

- Crude Oil production - Only the oil is delivered
- Aluminium smelting - The aluminium has to be smelted in specification
- Specialist machine tool production - Usage must be taught
- Restaurant - There are significant service as well as product aspects.
- Psychologist Therapy - Purely intangible

## Operations can be analysed on three levels

The flow between operations is the **supply network** also known as the *Supply
Chain*. It is the first level and is concerned with the flow of transformed
resources between operations & processes. The second level is the level of
*operation*, in which the flow between processes take place, such as cutting,
painting, packaging. External operations interact with the internal processes to
form the external supply network. The third level is the level of *process*, in
which there is a flow between resources. Processes form an internal *supply
network* and become each others customers and suppliers.

> Operations Management is concerned with the flow of transformed
> resources between operations & processes, where External operations interact

> suppliers.

All functions use processes to provide service. Every part of the organisation
uses processes to produce products or services for external customers.
