## What is supply chain management?
Supply chain management is the management of the interconnection of
organisations that relate to each other through upstream and downstream linkages
between the processes that produce value to the ultimate consumer in the form of
products/services.

## Why consider the whole supply network?
- It helps an understanding of competitiveness
    - Why other companies are able to cheaper than me? How do they do it?
    - Maybe their production method is better, or their delivery method is
      better?
- It helps identify significant links in the network
    - Who is an important part? Where are bottlenecks? Any potential risky
      linkages?
    - E.g. Hard-border no deal *brexit* having the result of added time being
      spent per unit at the border, a significant linkage in supermarket's
      supply network, effectively slowing down the process immensely.  
- It helps focus on long-term issues
- It helps focus on cost

## Performance objectives
- Quality
- Speed
- Dependability
- Flexibility / Agility
- Cost

## Relationships with suppliers

## Operations network for a plastic *homeware* company

## Operations network for a shopping mall

E.g. Retailers telling the shopping mall how much area for their store they need
and the mall providing that.

## The decision logic of outsourcing
![The process of determining whether to outsource]()

Where does outsourcing stop and the usage of a service start? Canvas/myCourses
is not outsourced, but rather a service used.

## Even the best models don't work forever
E.g. Dell, IBM, Compaq,

The shift from being B2B dominated industry to selling a computer to
individuals. Apple changed the model, targeting consumers mainly.

## Supply Chain relationships

## Factors for rating alternative suppliers
Short term ability to supply        | Long term ability to supply
----------------------------------- | ----------------------------
Range of products services provided | Potential for innovation
Quality of products/services        | Ease of doing business
Responsiveness                      | Willingness to share risk
Dependability of supply             | Long-term commitment to supply
Delivery and Volume flexibility     | Ability to transfer knowledge as well as products and services
Total cost of being supplied        | Technical capability
                                    | Financial capability
                                    | Managerial capability

## The Bullwhip Effect
A small change in the one side of the supply chain has big impacts /
fluctuations on the other side of the supply chain (e.g. the end).

![The Bullwhip Effect
illustrated](https://i.ibb.co/S7kDjmM/The-bullwhip-effect.png)

- The number above in *stock*, is the initial stock, where as the number below
  is the stock at the end of the time period considered. The lower number (final
  stock) in the prior time period is the same as the above number (initial
  stock) in the next time period.
- The *final stock* is equal to the demanded quantity / production (number to
  the right) 
- The production of one time period is equal to the final stock of the prior
  period minus the quantity demanded for the current time period.  

> We keep one period's stock as much as demanded
> The demand of the *1st level supplier* is the *original equipment MFG.'s*
> production. Et cetera, the *1st level supplier's* production equals the *2nd
> level supplier's* demand.

![The Bullwhip Effect Process](https://i.ibb.co/YLCwcbD/The-bullwhip-effect2.png)

The time lag between the moment that the retailer makes a sale and the moment
that the initial supplier produces, is the underlying reason for the effects of
*the Bullwhip*. E.g. Christmas orders are often very last minute and thus leave
little time for agile reactions from suppliers, according to retailer's sales,
thus much production is often being sold at a discount after Christmas, because
the production finished late.


## Methods for coping with the bullwhip effect

- Reducing uncertainty. This can be accomplished by centralizing demand
  information.
    - E.g. as above mentioned scenario with Christmas. Business intelligence can
      be applied here.
- Reducing variability. This can be accomplished by using a technique made
  popular by WalMart and then Home Depot called everyday low pricing (EDLP).
  EDLP eliminates price promotions as well as the shifts in demand that
  accompany them.
- Reducing lead time. Order times can be reduced by using EDI (electronic data
  interchange).
- Strategic partnerships. The use of strategic partnerships can change how
  information is shared and how inventory is managed within the supply chain.
  These will be discussed later.

## The effects of supply chain compression
![Effects of supply Chain
compression](https://i.ibb.co/cc6C1wB/effects-of-supply-chain-compression.png)

The time lag as the reason for the Bullwhip effect, as described above, is prone
to being tried to minimised. A way to decrease the time lag is to decrease the
intermediaries in the supply chain and thus decrease the *distance* between
communications.
