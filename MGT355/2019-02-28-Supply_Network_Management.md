## What is supply chain management?
Supply chain management is the management of the interconnection of
organisations that relate to each other through upstream and downstream linkages
between the processes that produce value to the ultimate consumer in the form of
products/services.

## Why consider the whole supply network?
- It helps an understanding of competitiveness
    - Why other companies are able to cheaper than me? How do they do it?
    - Maybe their production method is better, or their delivery method is
      better?
- It helps identify significant links in the network
    - Who is an important part? Where are bottlenecks? Any potential risky
      linkages?
    - E.g. Hard-border no deal *brexit* having the result of added time being
      spent per unit at the border, a significant linkage in supermarket's
      supply network, effectively slowing down the process immensely.  
- It helps focus on long-term issues
- It helps focus on cost

## Performance objectives
- Quality
- Speed
- Dependability
- Flexibility / Agility
- Cost

## Relationships with suppliers

## Operations network for a shopping mall

E.g. Retailers telling the shopping mall how much area for their store they need
and the mall providing that.

## The decision logic of outsourcing
![The process of determining whether to outsource]()

Where does outsourcing stop and the usage of a service start? Canvas/myCourses
is not outsourced, but rather a service used.

## Even the best models don't work forever
E.g. Dell, IBM, Compaq,

The shift from being B2B dominated industry to selling a computer to
individuals. Apple changed the model, targeting consumers mainly.
