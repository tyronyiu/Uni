## Glossary

**Product-Process Matrix**
: The vertical axis of the Product/Process matrix represents the type of
 production process in the company. In the questionnaire, it was asked what
 proportion of the products are produced in a unit production process, in small,
 medium or large batches, and in a continuous flow process.

**Work Content**
: The total amount of work required to produce a unit of output

**Work-in-process (WIP)**
: Amount of customers/products in the process

**Throughput time (TH)**
: The time for WIP to move through the process

**Cycle time (CT)**
: The average time between units of output emerging from the process

### Nature of Production processes

Process Tasks    | Process Flows | Variety | Volume
--------------   | ------------- | -----   | -------
Diverse/Complex  | intermittent  | high    | low
I                | I             | I       | I
I                | I             | I       | I
I                | I             | I       | I
Repeated/Divided | Continuous    | Low     | high

Jobbing Processes
(E.g. Rolex watch manufacturing)
        V
Batch Processes
(Range of size differentiates Batch
 from Mass process)
        V
Mass (line) processes
(Bricks, BIC pens et cetera)
        V
Continuous Processes
(Highly capital-intensive and automated
 Difficult and expensive to start/stop 
 the process. E.g. Nuclear facility/glass
 burning oven.)
        V
Professional service
(Clients spend a considerable time in the
 service process. There are high levels of 
 customisation)
        V
Service Shops
(Medium levels of volumes of customers
 Medium levels of customer contact, levels 
 of customisation and staff discretion.)
Mass Service
(High levels of volumes of customers, low
 levels of customer contact, customisation
 and staff discretion.)
```

### Classifying Products and Processes

Low Volume production processes allow higher diversity and complexity of the
product being produced as well as higher intermittence. The higher the volume,
the greater the decrease in complexity, skills needed for the job and the nature
turns to being a repeated process with divided tasks and continuous process
flow. Examples could be seen in the comparison between a *factory belt item*
such as *Nutella* vs a luxury item such as a *HÃ¨rmes* bag. The differences are
clear, one product's process tasks are standardised and repeated while having
great process flow throughput, where as the other product requires lots of
skilled, labour-intensive complex work and thus also takes longer.

A professional Service would classify as a low-volume, high-variety. Where as a
Mass service would be the opposite. In the medium, we see the service shop
class.
