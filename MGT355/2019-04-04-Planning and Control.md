## Overview
- Planning is a formalization of what is intended to happen at some time in the
  future
- A plan does not guarantee that an event will actually happen, it is a
  statement of intention
- Although plans are based on expectations, during their implementation things
  do not always happen as expected
- Control is the process of coping with any changes that affect the plan.  It
  may also mean that an ‘intervention’ will need to be made in the operation to
  bring it back ‘on track’

### Planning is deciding
- What activities should take place in the operation
- When they should take place
- What resources should be allocated to them

### Control is
- understanding what is actually happening in the operation
- deciding whether there is a significant deviation from what should be
  happening
- (if there is deviation) changing resources in order to affect the operation’s
  activities

- The degree of uncertainty in demand affects the balance between planning and
  control. The greater the uncertainty, the more difficult it is to plan, and
  greater emphasis must be placed on control.
- This idea of uncertainty is linked with the concepts of dependent and
  independent demand.  
    - Dependent demand is relatively predictable because it is dependent on some
      known factor 
    - Independent demand is less predictable because it depends on the chances
      of the market or customer behaviour

## Activities of Planning & Control

- Loading
    - Dictates the amount of work that is allocated to each part of the
      operation
- Sequencing
    - Decides the order in which work is tackled within the operation
    - Scheduling
    - Determines the detailed timetable of activities and when activities are
      started and finished
- Monitoring and control
    - Involve detecting what is happening in the operation, re-planning if
      necessary, and intervening in order to impose new plans
    - Two important types of are “pull” and “push” control
    - Pull control: demand is triggered by requests from a work centre’s
      (internal) customer
    - Push control: centralized system, where decisions are issued to work
      centres which are required to perform the task and supply the next
      workstation

**Push System**
: Where materials are passed on to the next production phase as soon as their
processed.

**Pull System**
: where materials are passed on to the next production phase as soon as they are
being requested from the progressing/next production phase.

## Sequencing
### Different approaches to sequencing
- Customer Priority: allows an important or aggrieved customer (or item) to be
  “processed” prior to others, irrespective of the order of arrival
- Physical constraints: physical constraints may determine the priority of work
  eg. Lighter shades of paint will be sequenced before darker ones
- Due date (DD): work is sequenced according to when it is “due” for delivery,
  irrespective of the size of each job or the importance of each customer
- Last-in-first-out (LIFO): Usually selected for practical reasons (eg.
  Unloading an elevator)
- First-in-first-out (FIFO): Serving customers in exactly the sequence they
  arrive in
- Longest operation time (LOT): Sequencing the longest jobs first in the system
  (better utilization of resources)
- Shortest operation time (SOT): Sequencing the shortest jobs first (useful when
  there are cash-flow problems)

### Main objectives of sequencing
- Meeting “due date” promised to customer (dependability)
- Minimizing the time the job spends in the process (speed)
- Minimizing work-in-progress inventory (element of cost)
- Minimizing idle time of work centres (another element of cost)

### Forward and backward scheduling
- Forward scheduling involves starting work as soon as it arrives
    - High labour utilization, flexible
- Backward scheduling involves starting jobs at the last possible moment to
  prevent from being late
    - Lower material costs
    - Less exposed to risk in case of schedule change by customer
