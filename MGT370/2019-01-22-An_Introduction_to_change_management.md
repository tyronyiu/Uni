## An introduction to change management

**Change Management** - Reacting to forces originating in the business
environment.

Change Management aims to oppose resistive forces. Mostly, human resources are
those that generate problematic situations. Thus, the resistive factor to
change, people are the entitity of focus. Change can occur from different
sources, e.g. a merger/acquisition or a political change such as Brexit
negotiations are examples of change considered. Kolb (David Kolb, 2019) has
determined a learning stratety aiming to diminish fear of finding fear. Fear is
a resistive factor to change.

> “If the rate of change on the outside exceeds the rate of change on the
> inside, the end is near.” - Jack Welch

Matching internal strengths and weaknesses with external threats and
opportunities in the elemental function of *SWOT* analysis. Thus, SWOT is a
necessary tool to be used in Change Management.

*"Brexit was caused by old people."* This statement is wrong, its correlation,
not causation. Old people may have the differences in their experiences from
when britain was not yet part of the EU and from when it was. Thus, the reason
for old people being more against staying in the EU is that they have a better
memory of how it was before.

### Forces for Change

- Knowledge Economy
- Virtual organisations
- Mergers/Acquisitions
- Electronic commerce
- Digital convergence
- privatization

### Two sides of Change

**Technical** *Vs.* **Human** side of Change

### Goals of Change Management

> Improving the organisation by altering how work is done.

### Change impacts the four parts of how the organisation operates.

1. Processes
2. Systems
3. Organisation structure
4. Job roles

Do you fit the new reality? Without adaption to change, survival will be
unlikely.

A disadvantage of bringin in a consultant firm for reacting to change is that
consulters do not know the stakeholders, who they are, what they want *et
cetera* and thus may not interpret the situation at hand considering all the
facts. The main problem is the motivation, the emotional detachment. 
 
## What is Change Management?

Structured approach to moving individuals , teams, organisations from a *current
state* to a *desired future state*. It depends on how much time will be needed,
resources available et cetera. How one defines where to be in future, is
subjective, thus *structure* is the framework in which objectives have to be
defined. A strong plan of action will ensure the journey of a thousand steps a
step at a time. Implicated interest in change will easen or harden the process
of implementing change or accepting the going forward in the first place. Change
affects different entities differently, some may perceive it positively, some
negatively. Organisational change management processes and individual change
management models.

### Four Features of Change Management

Change is the result of dissatisfaction with present strategies. it is essential
to develop a vision for better alternatives. Management have to develop
strategies to implement change. There will be resistance to change. There is an
essential difference between emotion and logic when perceiving Change. Change
can be analysed by either of two and thus result in different reactions.
Considering that one of both perceptive lenses are used when viewing Change, is
the responsibility of Management.

### Force Field Analysis

![Lewin's Force Field Analysis](https://cdn2.slidemodel.com/wp-content/uploads/6302-01-force-field-analysis-5.jpg){ width=300px }

There is a driving force and a restraining force. Logic dictates to have driving
forces to be greater, to allow Change to happen and hopefully ensure success.
Lewin model identified forces that drive change and forces restraining it.
Tools that should be used for a *structured* approach to Change are **SWOT,
Porter's Five, PESTEL, Boston Matrix and Stakeholder Analysis (power-interest
Matrix)** to identify my position in the environemnt, the forces affecting me,
what to change but also who is affected by any potential Change, thus helping in
identifying from where driving and restraining forces originate from. Important
to notice, is that forces are different from outcomes. The faster production
aspect is a result, not a force causing results.

Lewin's analysis can be used to investigate _**balance of power**, key
stakeholders, identify opponents and allies and how to _influence_ to target
groups_

#### Factors that drive Change internally

The desire to increase profitability, the need for reorganisation that leads to
an increase in efficiency, the *conflict within the firms* (between
departments) (This could also be the internal competition of Managers), the need and desire to change *organisational culture*.

#### Factors that drive Change externally

The customer demand present, the competition, cost of input, legislation &
taxes, political aspects, Ethical & Social values and Technological change are
factors that can lead to change. E.g. The *Ecological appeal* of sustainability
embodies itself in ethical values.

### Stakeholder mapping

With Stakeholder mapping the objective is to influence Key Stakeholders.
Opposing forcces can be turned into a driving force, but care has to be taken as
the same process can be reversed. That is why it is so important to identify
who, how, why the Stakeholders are how they are in order to influence them. The
question arising is: *What is the source of the Stakeholder's Power?*

Why do some Stakeholders behave resistive? Do they not undestand the objective
for change? Is the objective for change misunderstood? Did the Management
miscommunicate the objective? Problematic Employees can have several aspects of
why they are resistive, it is the Management's duty to identify these.

### Glossary

**Emergent Change** 
: Unexpected Change

**Failure to adapt to change** 
: Parameters of possible failure have to be defined as a part of the change to
react to. Thus, subjective to the entity in question. 

**Success to change**
: Whole plan, all dynamics and parameters get aligned.
