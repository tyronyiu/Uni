## Overview

> Although insurers recognize the power of analytics to grow, optimize and
> protect value, many continue to be overwhelmed by the far-reaching changes
> required to transition to value-driven decision-making.
>
> Ask yourself: What cultural and organizational changes are necessary to become
> data-driven and analytics-led? (*EY*, 2019)

### Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning for automated and self-optimising
risk analysis / risk classification of (potential) customers/clients. The risk
that a (potential) client of an insurance firm is exposed to, is vital to to be
identified, in order to adequately price the insurance. E.g. A construction
worker on a sky-rise building is exposed to more potential risk than a
construction worker that refurbishes the inside of an existing office building.

> For those who are yet to embark on their journey towards AI in insurance, it
> is key to start investing in Artificial Intelligence now. For leaders looking
> to steer their organizational ships into the auspicious waters of AI and start
> investing in AI, the following guiding principles apply:
>
> Assess the data at hand and accessible from the outside to get an initial idea
> of potential use cases, leveraging a bottom-up approach. 
> Start small with applications on the lower spectrum of complexity and
> iteratively scale to more complex solutions as you grow your expertise Don’t be
> afraid of failure as AI applications are prone to various challenges and the key
> to success is to rather fail fast than to burn resources on non-promising
> projects. (*Deloitte* 2019)

### Block-Chain
Modern technologies pose a thread to insurance firms, as very sensible data is
being stolen frequently. *Block-Chain* is the new player in digital data storage
on the field and is superior in nearly every aspect to traditional data storage.
(such as Databases like SQL, or even Cloud-based Data storage, but even more in
the aspect of how interactions are made with the data and how it is accessed
from a system. E.g. An HR employee making a request for an employee file
functions very differently *under the hood* for traditional methods and
*Block-Chain*) Block-Chains are distributed *Data-Snippets* (Ledgers for
financial data), and all the snippets together (in a chain) give the constituent
parts semantics and context, so that only in such way the data can be
interpreted correctly/adequately. Thus, hacking a Block-Chain Database requires
an attack on many many computers instead of e.g. a single server-farm, therefore
the attack is a lot more complex. Hence, the aspect of security / privacy is
interesting for the insurance firm / their clients and worth a consideration of
implementation as part of a *digitisation process*.

### Claim Settlement
> Two of the most important factors defining the efficiency of an insurance
> business is how fast it manages to settle claims, and how successfully it does
> it. Introduction of AI dramatically boosts both of these factors.
>
> A good example of a difference in speed is Lemonade’s AI Jim that made the
> industry news in January 2017 after settling a claim in less than three seconds.
> This is many orders of magnitude faster than the best human specialist can ever
> hope to achieve, as it rarely takes the less than a few weeks. (*TechGenix*,
> 2018)

### Fraud Detection

> It is physically impossible for human insurers to gather and process all the
> information about policyholders that can be an indication of fraud. Companies
> that rely on AI solutions are capable of processing virtually unlimited
> amounts of such information, which means that claims are settled not just
> faster than it is done traditionally, but also with a much lower percentage of
> fraud. Additional use of machine learning for fraud detection also means that
> AI learns to improve their results over time, getting the ability to notice
> the telltale signs of fraud more efficiently as they encounter its new and new
> instances.
>
> Needless to say, this is a major opportunity for saving money — insurance
> companies report more than $80 billion in fraudulent activities a year, and
> any technology that allows for their better and less effort-intensive
> detection is a godsend. (*TechGenix*, 2018)

> Insurers face intense pressure to enhance their anti-fraud and data security
> capabilities, as consumers and regulators call for increased transparency.
> (*EY*, 2019)

This can also be tied in with the above mentioned security aspects of
*Block-Chain*. Actual attempts to merge AI and Block-Chain by having the data be
*controlled*/managed (where it actually is, how its *fragmented* et cetera) have
been made and prove high potential for implementation, especially considering
data prone to tempering/malicious activity.

## Key Messages

The Key messages, that inform the company constituent entities about the change,
are the technologies to be employed. Those are mentioned above. The key messages
also create urgency for the change, signalising the need for these specific
implementations/changes. The above describes a general perception of such
technologies within the *insurance* industry and the usage/effects of employing
them. The productivity increase gained from automation is a significant
cost-lowering factor, which is often focused upon when realising change. Thus,
there are many/enough arguments for urgency/the need for these change
implementations, specifically affecting the IT sector/department of the
*RockCity* insurance company.

## Implementation actions

Many of these technologies are cutting/bleeding edge and are not employed as a
standard among industries. The creation/implementation of these digital systems
would thus probably not be performed internally, but would be outsourced. This
approach not only frees resources allocated, but also doesn't add additional
required resources (specialised IT labour) to the firm. 
The immediately above mentioned, is an important consideration when remembering
that these systems are mostly customer facing and/or interacted with by
non-IT-employees (internally).  Thus, there is no necessity for much specialised
IT labour. 

It would make a lot of sense to do training with non-IT-skilled labour, if there
are any left after the "re-structuring/*firing*" process. This training could
again be outsourced. My approach to training IT is to utilise *initial training*
and *continuous development*. A trainer/coach/IT-specialist could come in and
explain the systems to the employees that directly interact with it. The
training probably requires multiple sessions to reinforce understanding. Then,
employees should theoretically be able to help themselves out individually,
without requiring continuous training. The continuous development takes form in
collaboration between employees with a differing level of skill/understanding of
these IT systems. (*Also die leute fragen/beantworten sich gegenseitig fragen,
equivalent zu "der drucker geht nicht, weisst du wie?". - Das wird gewährleistet
dadurch, dass man sicherlich in dem mitarbeiter-pool [welcher nach der
restrukturierung/feuern neue+alte mitarbeiter enthält] einige individuen hat,
welche ein drastich höheres Verstandniss/skill von/mit IT systemen haben [Welche
for dem Change nicth vorhanden waren, genauso wenig die option dieses
"gegenseitiges development"].*) (Employee's should be
re-positioned/re-structured to complement each other in terms of
skills/understanding to minimise [initial] training required for *smooth
operation*.)
