## Individual Prerequisites for change to occur

Three sections, the *Head*, the *Heart* and the *Hands*, represent the thinking
and understanding perspective (Head), the emotional and motivational (Heart) and
Behavioural (Hands). Questions like *"Why should I change?"* or *"What's in it
for me?"* are questions that arise. Experience is the underlying principle, that
decides how people are going to behave, in a good as well as bad sense. Bad
perceived outcomes of change will be seen in experience and thus would lead to a
opposing view of the change. **Groupthink** describes an ignorance that emerges
from individual perceptions. One may be opposing a change to be made, that
person as part of a proposing group may adapt it's perception of the change to
be more positive. Thus, being honest, realistic and factual can hinder this kind
of ignorance by setting straight the facts. On a *international* scale, it
takes much longer to integrate change and common consensus can help accelerate
this process.

## Kurt Lewin's Model

His model is a simple framework for managing change known as *unfreeze, change
and refreeze*. Lewin explained organisational change using the analogy of
changing the *shape of a block of ice*. E.G. Unfreezing a large cube of ice to
change it and reform it into a cone of ice. The risks involved during the
unfreezing - refreezing process have to be considered. After having figured out
the change, how to make it happen? By recognising the three distinct stages of
change, one can plan to implement the changes required. Starting off with *the
motivation to change (unfreeze)* as it is necessary to change existing attitudes
towards working practices and prepare the ground. *Communication* about the
proposed change is vital, if people are to understand and support the to be made
changes. After effective communications and the empowering of people to embrace
new ways of working and learning new values, problems are identified and action
plans developed to enable implementation. Maximum flexibility is needed in the
planning and implementation of change. Emergent changes may arise, that will
contribute towards the greater objective, thus agility is needed as emergent
changes and unpredictabilities can interfere with implementation. The process
ends when the organisation returns to a *sense of stability (refreeze)* and the
benefits of the change are realised. *Praise, rewards* and other reinforcements
are required on an individual level and more effective performance at an
organisational level. Not until the change has become incorporated into the
culture can it be said to be *frozen*.

## Importance of Communication in Empowerement and Organisational Change

Have people internally have come to peace with the change?  Klein(1996)
provided evidence concerning the way communication process can help employees.
Feedback and adjustments have to paired with strategies that encourage
*disclosure* of problems. Discussion of solutions through intensive
*face-to-face communication* between management and employees, was helpful.
The  *Just-in-time* model can be used as a philosophical model to refocus on
urgent/priority matters and identifying what is working and what not. These
conversations can also become unnecessary when having them too often.

### Brain evolution: from emotional responses to cognition

Not being cavemen anymore, but civilised 21st century humans, our perception
changed, as well as how our brain works. A stimulus will trigger 100% in the
emotional part of the brain and not a rational brain region. Knowing that the
first reaction will always be emotional, we can now start constructing
frameworks and strategies to leverage this fact for change making. 

### How an abstract term can be perceived?

*Business transformation - Marger and acquisition:* Lay-offs (as a perceived
potential outcome) generate fear and activate *fight or flight*, where as
systems optimisation (as an outcome) generates participation and activates
positive decision making. Circumstances can be perceived differently and thus
opinions and perceptions of employees have to be considered as subjective. Is
what people are telling me actually what they want to tell me or is it an
emotional reaction? Emotional matters are often polarised and thus create
extreme views of emotional projections of the change. Having employees know what
the plan is, how to implement it et cetera, is vital for them not to solely
react emotionally but have a rational stance on the circumstance.

#### Following the way the brain makes its own stories

1. Motivation / Why
    - Intrinsic motivation
2. Understanding / What
    - Focus on the process of change
3. Building the thinking patterns
    - Individual ownership

First the intrinsic motivation has to be communicated, why a change has to be
made. Communicating what needs to be changed is the second step, to start
rational thinking processes known as building the thinking patterns. Emotions
fog your vision and rational thinking using strategy and logic makes you see
clear, spot potential discrepancies or problems.

## Sustainable Change

It is about making sure that every change process will be successful. The idea
is, that team training is necessary to develop skills and knowledge of employees
to increase business productivity by the transfer of technical skills.
Sustainable change depends on habits formed, mind management, skills and
knowledge, and embedding these aspects into productive habits & processes for
the new business productivity process. We are embedding the new values into the
corporate culture.

## key successful factors in human performance

![Mind Activity, Cognitive & Affective processes](https://i.ibb.co/hBH3r8d/mind-activity.png)

People + Systems + Process = Business Delivery and Growth. There are *Cognitive
processes* and *Affective processes*, which are both subsets of *Mind
Activity* .Cognitive processes include Decision making, problem solving,
adaptation, communication and innovation. Affective processes include emotional
regulation, stress management, emotional intelligence and self regulation. If
the initiator of change does not understand the change fully, it cannot be
possibly be integrated into business practices.

### Face to Face activation

When we experience face to face communication, mirror neurons fire at 1/6th of a
second in team bonding to reach a contagion effect. Self identification in the
subconsciousness can allow successful manipulation techniques, given a
categorical imperative based behaviour system.

#### Spindle Neurons

*Function:* Global firing rate regulation and regulation of emotional state
*Shape:* Unique spindle-shaped projection neuron *Location:* Anterior cingulate
cortex and Fronto-insular cortex They Are very long and combine emotion, belief
and judgement to establish empathy and trust. These neurons fire very fast, at
1/20th second.

### Neuroplasticity

![Neuroplasticity](https://gnapi98748.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/12023iA82B11DE563E5CF4?v=1.0)

The brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections
throughout life. Neuroplasticity allows the neurons (nerve cells) in the brain
to compensate for injury and disease and to adjust their activities in response
to new situations or to changes in their environment. Given the initiator of
change, be it implicit or explicit in nature, will enable one to rewire their
brain pathways.

## SCARF Model

![The SCARF Model](http://www.edbatista.com/images/2010/03/SCARF_Model.jpg)

![The SCARF Model described](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a4/b6/be/a4b6be238f98e0d783f815a22e2409bb.jpg)

The *SCARF* model is based on neuroscience research that implies that these five
social domains activate the same threat and reward responses in our brain that
we rely on for physical survival. Feeling threatened blocks our creativity,
reduces our ability to solve problems, and makes it harder for us to communicate
and collaborate with others. But, when we feel rewarded, our self-confidence
soars, we feel empowered, and we want to do a good job.

The SCARF Model can help you to minimize perceived threats, and to maximize the
positive feelings generated through reward when working alongside others. Doing
this can help us to collaborate better, to coach people, and to provide more
effective training and feedback.  This "primitive" reaction helps to explain the
sometimes strong emotional reactions that we can have to social situations – and
why it's often hard to control them. It's instinct, and unfortunately we can't
just "turn it off." For example, when we are left out of an activity, we might
perceive it as a threat to our status and relatedness. Research has shown that
this response can stimulate the same region of the brain as physical pain. In
other words, our brain is sending out the signal that we're in danger.
Furthermore, when we feel threatened – either physically or socially – the
release of cortisol (the "stress hormone") affects our creativity and
productivity. We literally can't think straight, and this increases the feeling
of being threatened.  On the flip side, when we feel rewarded (for instance,
when we receive praise for our work) our brains release dopamine – the "happy
hormone." And, of course, we want more!

> **Key Takeaways**
> The SCARF Model was first developed by David Rock in 2008. It suggests that

> training and feedback.

## Change Capacity

When we interact with each other, build trust and solid team work. Motor neuron
system trigger *dopamine*, lowering resistance to new ideas and gives more
information absorbed. The higher dopamine levels also increase creativity and
innovation.

## Kotter’s 8-Step Plan for implementing change

1. Establish a sense of urgency by creating a compelling reason for why change
   is needed.
2. Form a coalition with enough power to lead the change.
3. Create a new vision to direct the change and strategies for achieving the
   vision.
4. Communicate the vision throughout the organization.
5. Empower others to act on the vision by removing barriers to change and
   encouraging risk taking and creative problem solving.
6. Plan for, create, and reward short-term “wins” that move the organization
   toward the new vision.
7. Consolidate improvements, reassess changes, and make necessary adjustments in
   the new programs.
8. Reinforce the changes by demonstrating the relationship between new behaviors
   and organizational success.

## Change Causes Anxiety

Change Causes Anxiety as an energy. It can be positive and negative, given that
positive can induce creativity, trust, respect, where as negative fear can
create a lack of the above, people might not agree as a change as being
necessary (especially not when no collaboration/communication has been taken
place),

## Effect of clear, consistent values

Induces high group trust, stronger collective identity, higher contribution and
more creativity. Collaboration required clear and consistent values for
self-identification to occur.

## Respect

**Talk positively with people**

- Brain looks for alignment
- Matches things with resonate
- Think long term (consequential)
- Potential neurogenesis (PSNS)

Where as a lack of respect will lead to:

**Ordering people produces the following:**

- Brain looks for differences and analyses data for why they are wrong
- Closes down optimism
- Short term goal
- Minimises contribution

## Empowerment

Meaningfulness adds value to an action, especially for employee management.
Choice engages judgement about an aspect. Competence relates to satisfaction and
pride while progress indicates moving forwards a character, until the firm's and
the employee's values align.

![Barriers to Empowerment](https://i.ibb.co/cTBpKFM/barriers-to-empowerment.png)

Employees being boxed in, can be freed using empowerment. Barriers are
necessary, but placing them in the correct places, for the correct people is
important.

### Empowerment vs control

Flat management styles align with the tool of empowerment, where as hierarchy
style uses control to personalise time of employees. Communication is key in
this process, to bring control terms / empowerment aspects to the employees.

## Organizational Stressors: Role Demands

**Role conflicts**
: Work expectations that are hard to satisfy, thus management should clearly
define and re-adjust expectations.  

**Role overload**
: Having *more work* to accomplish than time permits  

**Role ambiguity**
: When role expectations are not clearly understood  

Employee's roles within the company are vital, employees need to know what their
role is to perform it. Thus, the role has to be clearly defined. If the role is
not executed as expected, why is that? Was it not correctly described in the
first place? Does the employee have too much work and too little time and hence
the job doesn't get done? Or does the employee not understand what he/she is
supposed to do? Laying out the role completely and without any loopholes for
misunderstanding, is vital for employees to not come and complain about wrong
job descriptions.

### Too much work, too little time

A national sample of U.S employees finds that they:

- Feel overworked 54%
- Are overwhelmed by workload 55%
- Lack time for reflection 59%
- Don’t have time to complete tasks 56%
- Must multi-task too much 45%

## Work stress and managing it

**Stress**
:A dynamic condition in which an individual is confronted with:

- an opportunity, 
- constraint, or 
- demand related 

![A model of stress](https://i.ibb.co/Fqg3x28/Model-of-stress.png)

## Managing stress

- Organizational Approaches
    - Improved personnel selection and job placement
    - Training
    - Use of realistic goal setting
    - Redesigning of jobs
    - Increased employee involvement - Improved organizational communication
    - Offering employee sabbaticals
    - Establishment of corporate wellness programs 


## Four Styles of management to implement change

**Consultative**
: Employees are kept informed about the changes and could discuss possible
outocmes with the management before the manangement made the decision.

**Directive**
: The workforce is informed about the changes and why those changes are
important but they are not given the opportunitiy to express an opinion.

**Coercive**
: The workfore is told that they must obey the new instructions. No information
was provided or their opinions asked.

*Fine tuning*
: gentle change at unit scale level
