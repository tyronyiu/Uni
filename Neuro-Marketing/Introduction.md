*The Neuro-marketing Toolbox*: The methods to do neuro-marketing with 

### A short history of marketing

### The brain is predictably irrational

### Ethical Considerations

### Assignments
The goal is to increase (returning) customer satisfaction, by minimising
disrupting factors such as stress or queuing.
E.g. The stressful and queued security check minders positivity.

## The updated Toolbox
The toolbox includes the following methods:

- **Brain Imaging** (implicit measures)
    - EEG
    - FMRI
    - FNIRS
- **Physiological** (implicit measures)
    - Eye movement
    - Pupil dilation
    - Heart rate
    - Galvanic skin response
- **Online** (implicit measures)
    - Reaction time tasks
    - Association tasks
    - Visual search tasks

### Why do we need a new toolbox?
Traditional tools: Focus groups, interviews, surveys
**We ask for their opinion** -> *Biased answer, as being close to the
situation.* Unconscious influence of external/internal factors affecting choice
or opinion.

The updated Toolbox focuses on analysing *System 1*, the fast and subconscious
system, where as traditional tools are much more adequate analysing the
rational methodology of *System 2*.

#### Common problematics 
That the traditional toolbox struggles with and why there is a need for a
revised methodology of measuring reactions.

##### Socially desirable answering
Some answers and topics are socially undesirable to talk about, such can be the
question whether or not one prefers *"Trump over Clinton"*, or whether one is
*"pro Brexit"*. Thus, the social pressure of abnormality and being excluded from
society because of that abnormality, steers and influences socially desirable
answers.

##### faulty introspection (unconscious decision making)
Given, that people are not aware of the factors influencing them unconsciously,
they tend to give a reason of being *nudged* towards a given choice due to more
primitive factors.

> Often consumers don't have a good understanding of what really drives their own behaviour. 

##### Strategic answering
Some answers are given with an intention in mind to disguise the true opinion.
An example could be the stimuli: *"How much would you pay for this product?"* -
To which one could understate the price willing to pay, considering their
affinity towards that product. Thus, their intent is to lower the price with
their answer.
Another example could be a hiring interview, in which one would clearly answer
lying, with a strategy in mind, than telling the truth, with the objective in
mind to increase one's position within the perception of the interviewer.

### Eye Tracking
Eye tracking is the most frequently used Neuro-marketing technique, because it
is easy to use and cheap considering modern technological advancements. Eye
tracking is the ideal example of why asking questions is sometimes impossible.

E.g. *"What did you notice in the file?"*, *"What stood out the most on the way
to class"*

**Bottom-up attention**
: Through eye tracking we know which marketing elements draw the attention. It
is good to know what draws attention in order to make conclusions about whether
or not what needs to be seen is being seen or what should be minimised to be
seen.

**Top-down attention**
: Through eye tracking we know what people want to pay attention to, or what
they're looking for. When looking for book-shops, they will be easier recognised
visually and attention will be drawn to those subjects.

**Liking, Wanting & Emotions**
: Through eye tracking we know what people like/want/enjoy. Just by comparing
products and how people looked at them can give indication about their
preference.

Eye movements consist of *fixations* and *saccades*. Fixations are when the
brain focuses on a point and captures information, where as saccades are the
process of when the eyes move from one to another point to focus on.

The two eye tracking methods, being stationary and mobile, have their advantages
and disadvantages such as being more adequate for contingent situations or for
special circumstances. Mobile eye tracking changes physical environment, thus
the analysis of the data is much harder to classify.
