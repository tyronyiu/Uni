## Introduction Session

Instructor: Timothy Desmet

*The Neuro-marketing Toolbox*: The methods to do neuro-marketing with 

### A short history of marketing

### The brain is predictably irrational

### Ethical Considerations

### Assignments
The goal is to increase (returning) customer satisfaction, by minimising
disrupting factors such as stress or queuing.
E.g. The stressful and queued security check minders positivity.

## The updated Toolbox
The toolbox includes the following methods:

- **Brain Imaging** (implicit measures)
    - EEG
    - FMRI
    - FNIRS
- **Physiological** (implicit measures)
    - Eye movement
    - Pupil dilation
    - Heart rate
    - Galvanic skin response
- **Online** (implicit measures)
    - Reaction time tasks
    - Association tasks
    - Visual search tasks

### Why do we need a new toolbox?
Traditional tools: Focus groups, interviews, surveys
**We ask for their opinion** -> *Biased answer, as being close to the
situation.* Unconscious influence of external/internal factors affecting choice
or opinion.

The updated Toolbox focuses on analysing *System 1*, the fast and subconscious
system, where as traditional tools are much more adequate analysing the
rational methodology of *System 2*.

#### Common problematics 
That the traditional toolbox struggles with and why there is a need for a
revised methodology of measuring reactions.

##### Socially desirable answering
Some answers and topics are socially undesirable to talk about, such can be the
question whether or not one prefers *"Trump over Clinton"*, or whether one is
*"pro Brexit"*. Thus, the social pressure of abnormality and being excluded from
society because of that abnormality, steers and influences socially desirable
answers.

##### faulty introspection (unconscious decision making)
Given, that people are not aware of the factors influencing them unconsciously,
they tend to give a reason of being *nudged* towards a given choice due to more
primitive factors.

> Often consumers don't have a good understanding of what really drives their own behaviour. 

##### Strategic answering
Some answers are given with an intention in mind to disguise the true opinion.
An example could be the stimuli: *"How much would you pay for this product?"* -
To which one could understate the price willing to pay, considering their
affinity towards that product. Thus, their intent is to lower the price with
their answer.
Another example could be a hiring interview, in which one would clearly answer
lying, with a strategy in mind, than telling the truth, with the objective in
mind to increase one's position within the perception of the interviewer.

## Implicit measures

### Eye Tracking
Eye tracking is the most frequently used Neuro-marketing technique, because it
is easy to use and cheap considering modern technological advancements. Eye
tracking is the ideal example of why asking questions is sometimes impossible.

E.g. *"What did you notice in the file?"*, *"What stood out the most on the way
to class"*

**Bottom-up attention**
: Through eye tracking we know which marketing elements draw the attention. It
is good to know what draws attention in order to make conclusions about whether
or not what needs to be seen is being seen or what should be minimised to be
seen.

**Top-down attention**
: Through eye tracking we know what people want to pay attention to, or what
they're looking for. When looking for book-shops, they will be easier recognised
visually and attention will be drawn to those subjects.

**Liking, Wanting & Emotions**
: Through eye tracking we know what people like/want/enjoy. Just by comparing
products and how people looked at them can give indication about their
preference.

Eye movements consist of *fixations* and *saccades*. Fixations are when the
brain focuses on a point and captures information, where as saccades are the
process of when the eyes move from one to another point to focus on.

The two eye tracking methods, being stationary and mobile, have their advantages
and disadvantages such as being more adequate for contingent situations or for
special circumstances. Mobile eye tracking changes physical environment, thus
the analysis of the data is much harder to classify.

### Physiological implicit measures

**Galvanic Skin Response** / Skin conductance

Arousal as distraction/focus implies physiological effects, such as a raised
heart beat frequency, dilated pupils et cetera. As there are many physiological
effects, we measure *galvanic skin response and heart rate variability*.
Arousal can be of feared nature or desired nature, such are fear of e.g.
predators or sexual encounters.

### Emotions and attention in Commercials

[FIAT 500s advert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoC1QWlLFKI)

a) What emotions do you think are triggered by the commercial?
    Joy, Hapiness, weirdness, surprise, cringe
b) List main emotions for different time windows
    0-7: neutral, joy
    7-19: Weirdness, surprise, joy
    19-28: Joy, happiness, funny
    28 - : neutral 
c) Do you think the emotional profile is appropriate?
    Its staged - funny (controllable imitiation of women actions) -> sexism?
d) 5 attracting aspects Do they contribute to the story line of the commercials?
    Kicking, the bag, walk away (testing guy), Real-life/women action
e) Logo processing?
   Bad BoyS, logo is always small - but its known that FIAT is the company in
   question, If there weren't any sound, you'd probably miss that it's FIAT
   explicitly. The logo is central at the very end - attention slip? 

## The nervous System

*Neuro* in *"neuromarketing"* refers to our entire nervous system (central +
peripheral). 

The nervous system is the system containing all nerve cells (neurons).

![Nerve
cell](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Neuron.svg/1200px-Neuron.svg.png)

Sensory neurons get information from the outside world and pass it via other
neurons to the CNS. The Interneurons get information from neurons and pass it on
to other neurons, where as motor neurons get informed from the CNS and activate
muscles, organs etc.

**Neuroplasticity**
: The brain forms new neurons and the connections and functions can change or adapt throughout our lives.

**The Triune Brain Theory**
: from Macleon is too simplistic. Every brain structure has been changed through evolution.

## Sight & Perception

## Smell Test

Containers containing different smells were passed around for recognition. Most
were recognised to have been smelled before, but the classification, the
association with a specific odor-donor was rare. This illustrates how our brain
can easily recognise but not as easy classify/associate. Most of the time we
smell in conjunction with visual inputs while knowing what the smell is going to
be, we don't necessarily "save" smells by their smell and definition but as an
additional piece of information for identification.

## Sensory Information

It makes sense not to process all sensory information. Instead our nervous
system is wired to assign relevance to certain information, so that less
relevant stimuli do not diminish capacity.

Sensory information can make its way to the mind by sheer force. This is known
as bottom-up attention. (Senses are stimulated and produce effects higher up in
the processing system.)

Bottom up attention is automatic, fast and non-volutional.

**Saliency** can affect consumer choice especially when we dont have much time
to decide.

## How to grab attention

### Make them search
When needing a lift and thinking about *Uber* instead of a regular Taxi service,
*Uber* has a marketing advantage.

### Make it easy to find
Laziness drives people's behaviour and ease of use has a lower threshold of
activation required to associate a certain brand with a specific product.

### Make it salient
Saliency and presence can be a big impact in situations of being unsure and
system one making a fast decision based on the environment.

### Less is more
But there are limits to it. Think about *Nutella* and think away the visuals and
leave nothing but the logo. The composition doesn't match and wouldn't be
successful, the question arising is whether or not that is due to the visuals
being so consistent over time that they have become part of the brand or if the
visual is appealing because of the visuals, not the brand.

## Consciousness
Exists in two definitions, the mental state and as the content. The content
describes when you are awake, alert and in the moment, but some information is
processed consciously and other information unconsciously. The mental state
refers to unconsciousness as being in a vegetative or conscious responsive
state, which is less relevant for marketing purposes.
Conscious vs unconscious information might be a contiuum. E.g. tip-of-the-tongue
phenomenon. Show pictures of famous people and test the ability to name them -
some names will be *"known"*, to be somewhere in the brain, but it can't be
located because of the many associations made with *"famous people"*.

### The Unconscious and its impacts

Sometimes unconscious processes are at an advantage, for example in defense
situations. Unconscious processes require less energy and are thus predominant
in situations impacted by *ease* of choice. You wouldn't put the same
*effort/energy* into the purchase of a toothpaste compared to that of a house.
*Auto-pilot* often called, is a state in that we go to *save energy*.

Another unconscious behaviour are instinctive behaviours that can influence the
buying decision making process. Expensive diapers may unconsciously be bought
and preferred for the baby as the baby is of high value and only the best wants
to be provided for that baby.

Habits and automatic behaviours are very similar, one might always choose *Lucky
Strike* cigarettes over *Marlboro*, for no apparent reason other than being used
to it and the automatic habit of choosing becomes automated.

Evaluation and labelling on the first sight has a huge impact on the internal
image we have with that person, which is based on the associations we make with
certain *outfits* or behaviours. On flights, a free drink in the beginning that
diminishes anger for bad service or delays. Another example is *Abercrombie &
Fitch*, who make people wait in front of their stores that make those having
waited feel relief and reward in the sense of "finally I'm in this exclusive
store".

## Emotions

> *What's the favourite and least favourite brand, why?*
>
> **Favourite:** Apple, SpaceX, 
> **Least Favourite:** Google, Facebook   
> Responsibility for the society/planet et cetera. Everyone can build a product,
> and building a good product is also *easy*, but building a sustainable,
> responsible and good product isn't.
> Google's behaviour is outrageous, where as Apple's should be rewarded. There's
> a strong emotional association between Google and *outrage*, negativity and
> *pride*, positivity for Apple.

Are the most important predictor for behaviour.

### Emotions & Feelings
The body has *emotions* and the mind is interpreting those to associate them to
*feelings*. Emotions cause bodily responses like pupil dilation, heart frequency
increases and galvanic skin response increase. They are event related... 
Emotions can be triggered by external or internal stimuli. An external stimuli
is someone slapping someone else, where as an internal stimuli would be a
situation a few days later where the two people approach each other and the one
having been slapped internally becomes angry because of the personal association
with that person and being slapped.

*insert missing slides here*

A emotion can become conscious and trigger a *feeling*. Mood is less specific
and intense, it's less likely to be evoked by a certain stimulus or event, thus
it is less event-related than emotional stimuli. Mood is often thought of as
related to ones personality. It seems as though mood is a much *slower* process
than *emotions* or *feelings*

Animals share emotions with humans, such as jealousy are also present in
primates:
