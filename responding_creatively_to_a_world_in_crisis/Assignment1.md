\begin{abstract}
How to build a better relationship between the human and the
more-than-human-world: Human persistence on planet earth is endangered and needs
to be resolved. The framework of the five fires for change 
facilitates five themes for the world and its crises to be perceived through.
Not only is the human world endangered, but the more-than-human-world
respectively, being within each others domain. Hence, it has become vital for
preservation of any world, that change is being conducted intentionally and
in a planned manner.

**Most information is within the mind-map, this only contains a few core
thoughts in a more formal, streamlined, written form.**

## Empathy (listen)
Empathy can be seen as *effective communication*. If *listening* has a loss of
information in its communication channel, there can be a minimisation of said
loss. This minimisation in this case is intentionally listening carefully for
information to be absorbed.  Now, if that is the case, the communication channel
has been made more effective. The concept of empathy doesn't limit itself on
hearing, though. One can synonymously see *listening* with *observing* and thus
it's about observing some sort of development, some sort of change.

## Kinship (connect)
Connection is vital, earth's processes are connected to each other by affecting
each other, people and communities are connected through communication
(effective or non-effective, depending on the implementation of empathy) and
even the five fires are interconnected as one can increase the effect of the
other if present.

## Earth (contextualise)
The earth fire refers to earths' processes and the human integration of such
processes. To do so, context is required to identify spots of potential
implementation of a human process within the earths' process cycle, to achieve a
certain objective. Such objective could be the gain of a resource like fish,
which with help of breeding, without overfishing could yield high results
without disrupting the earths' hydrosphere process. -> If the net-count of fish
at a certain point of time is the same with or without a human process
integrated.

## Tools (design)

> Assuming concepts of *The Homo Faber* / "man the maker" and **Man as a
> defective creature** - Arnold Gehlen.

A tool can either be a tool, in its material and commonly assumed nature, or a
person used for a given objective. Such would mean that an entity of men, a
group, community, firm or state could also be a tool or tools, depending on
aiming at the entity as a whole or the individuals that make it up.
Given that man uses tools to shape its environment and make up for its
imperfectness and defects, these tools can be used in many ways. It is important
to only realise that multiple instances of one tool could be used by multiple
people simultaneously or one tool could be operated by multiple people
simultaneously. Understanding the multilateral reality and complexity of tools
and their usage, without regard of their objective or intent, is vital for
connecting the fires effectively to drive change. This idea has been visualised
as well, with the help of pictography within the mind-map.

## Hope (manifest)
Hope is the origin of energy opposing the resistive force of restraint towards
change. As the law of inertia states how the only the imbalance of forces can
cause change, the imbalance in this case is the hope causing energy to drive
action. The fear of the uncertainty of the future is the resistive force,
slumbering in people, opposing that force. 

As well, hope can be multilateral and multi-perspective. Within the mind-map,
this concept/idea of multilateral consideration and considerations from
different perspectives also applies to hope, in the sense that hopes can
interfere with each other. Knowing that, it is also noteworthy to point out, how
desire strictly differs from hope, which has been visualised with help of
Maslow's pyramid of needs. 

## Endword
I'd love to have included sound-files/images etc. but will likely do so in the
second assignment as is falls more in line with my strengths (writing over
creatively creating, like mind-maps) and thus feel more coherent when reading.
