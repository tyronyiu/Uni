\begin{abstract}
Currently, our world is undoubtedly in multiple crises. From social, political,
economic or environmental, it seems as though circumstances are extremely
polarised. \textit{Maslow's} hierarchic model of needs and wants for humans
states that the actualisation of potential is to be achieved solely after the
satisfaction of in the hierarchy underlying needs. Henceforth, the exhaustion of
human potential is not the case, for most people in the current state of the
world.  One could classify this as a crisis, arguing that not exhausting
individuals' potential, whether in the classical way productive, creative,
innovative, something aught contributing, may be a significant factor towards
the decisions made and actions taken, which brought the world to its current
state, in multiple crises.\\
The proposed provision of human basic needs managed by automation aims at
raising the hierarchic state of \textit{Maslow's} model that most people find
themselves in.  As a further consequence, the raise in state of human needs will
have effects upon the social, political, economic and environmental state of the
world.

Maslow's Theory of Human Motivation states that there are distinct levels in
which one can find themselves in, these levels represent the needs that on longs
for. As soon as one experiences a change of the state of the level they are in,
their needs adapt. 

The stages are: *"physiological", "safety", "belonging and
love", "esteem",* and *"self-actualization"*. The lowest stage, physiological
sources need for e.g. water, food, sleep, essential needs to survive. The second
stage provides shelter from the elements and predators. The third, the inclusion
within society and acceptance. Fourth, the distinction and individuality of one
and realisation of such. Which ties in with the last stage, in which prior
realised individual skills/talents are fully exhausted in terms of potential.

As these stages rise, arguably there is an increase in two aspects, the time that
individuals have available and the productive output due to higher efficiency /
effectiveness, which is potential, as the time for that needs to be chosen to be
taken. \newline
As an example, as soon as shelter is established within a society, there
is a lot less time wasted on precautions and worrying, arguably the better
mental state also affects individuals positively. So, that more time can be spent
on creating meaningful relationships or better producing food, instead of
running from predators and worrying about their lives.

> The goal is to raise humanity up in these stages of Maslow's hierarchy and
> thus create a better tomorrow. 

That thought, of having more time to spend on pressing issues is key.\newline
Another thought that is key, is to realise that pressing issues that do not
align with the personal needs of an individual will not be pursued, and thus if
one longs for food or shelter, he will give little regard for his surroundings,
where as when he'd have everything he'd need, he could contribute towards making
the general society better and help others achieve the state he's at. \newline
Such seemingly *altruistic* behaviour seems abnormal, though is and always has
been seen as *to be aspired and be strived towards*. Throughout time, in ancient
Greece, the character of the philosopher has been seen as *to be strived
towards*. \newline
Though has the philosopher, in ancient Greece, been made laughter of by many
people of middle class, clearly beneath the state a philosopher would find
himself. So, a famous anecdote of Thales is how a maid ridiculed him.

> Thales fell plumpe into a ditche over the eares. Wherefore an olde woman that
> he kepte in his house laughed and sayde to him in derision: O Thales, how
> shuldest thou have knowlege in hevenly thinges above, and knowest nat what is
> here benethe under thy feet? (Burnyeat, Levett & Plato. 1990)

The other anecdote famously known is how he responded to the mocking about the
necessity of the profession of a philosopher. He is said to have predicted a big
olive harvest, on which's prediction he made a lot of money to prove that his
seemingly poor existence is in his will and that a philosopher could in fact
earn money, though it is not what is aspired to be done, being a philosopher.

> On the other hand, there is the question of whether the focus on the *hevenly
> thinges* distracts from pressing issues that reside *benethe under thy feet*.
> (Burnyeat, Levett & Plato. 1990)

> Or if the focus on the *hevenly thinges* only occurs if there are no pressing
> issues residing *under thy feet*, when having ascended the hierarchy, as is
> thus, but merely a temporal distraction, equal to a dream.

--------------------------------

\textbf{\large{The proposition}} is to make people become *philosophers*,
figuratively.
When making people philosophers, one ends up with a society of philosophers.
Ascend society to a higher stage in *Maslow's hierarchy*, or bring everyone to a
common minimum stage. Surely, that is not as diverse, as Plato writes in *"The
republic"*, but it doesn't need to be. \newline
Technology and the advancements we have today do not require men working the
fields to survive, we can leave that behind as a necessity, though still enjoy
these activities for pleasure. The basic human needs will be taken care of by
automated systems, similar to as in *the venus project* (The Venus Project,
2019), so that man doesn't have to worry about whether their kids can eat, but
about how to solve quantum gravity. As a consequence, provided by the
individuals, there will be benefits to society. If one were to find a cure for
cancer, all cancer patients can benefit from that cure, not only one person
alone. \newline
The alignment of interests of society's and individuals' is the key aspect to
consider for undertaking a change as proposed. Furthermore, the interests need
identification and verification first, before they can be labelled as selfish or
beneficial. The labelling process will need a framework to base the decision on,
as *bad & good* aren't objective and exact quantifiable measures. Thus, the
aspect of how beneficial is something to the envisioned society, is governed
through a dynamic framework that considers multiple cornerstones, so that
besides missing context a decision/action can be labelled *good / bad*. The
framework aims at removing subjectivity and context, as those are subject to
motive and interest, which are planned to be aligned with society's. Thus, a
label solely refers to, how a decision/action is, in context of that planned
society.

The question of *how* to achieve this ascension in the hierarchy, can be
answered using the framework of *five fires of change*. \newline
This framework aids in the transition *"from a state of languishing to one of
flourishing" (Class, 2019)*. It is a fit for the purpose of transitioning
humanity to a higher on the hierarchy laying stage.
One can see how these *fires* are inter-connected. Affect each other. Hence, the
idea of conjoining their potentials seems close to have.

### Empathy

The assumption is, that a human, with more time to spent on upper-level hierarchy
stage things, like relationships, status or self-actualisation, will be able to
be a more empathetic human.

A more empathetic human would be able to connect more and better with his peers,
with more intellectual or enjoyable topics and activities. The reasoning of a
human being more empathetic when being in the upper stages of Maslow's
hierarchy, could be counter argued with the fact, that someone in desperate need
would experience empathy as a tool to satisfy that need. An example could be how
one could be imprisoned and by using empathy on their guards, they could
increase the chance of getting out and better treatment. \newline
But that empathy differs from the empathy experienced and propagating from
someone in the upper stages with no such problems, as the intention and thus the
consequential effect upon the *greater* differ distinctively. After all, the
needs of the individual should be aligned with the needs of the society.
There's the biggest pressing issue, the *viscosity* of society. For any change
to happen within the aggregate society, time and drive is required. 

Empathy is vital for the survival of the proposed idea, as it is the backbone
assumption to have a more empathic human. It is vital, because within the
*connections* made to propagate the idea within an existing society, empathy
plays an enormous role for the successful propagation. A empathic person would
*listen* actively to the proposal, see its benefits and could align their own
interests with that proposal's. Empathy is required for the successful
propagation of any information exchange via humans. 

### Kinship

Given the assumption of empathy separately, one can also assume, that the upper
stage human is guiding his gaze much greater into the distance, opposite to
looking at oneself. This thought, though also indicates that there is a
difference within retro-reflection and selfish thinking/planning/action-taking.

The connections that a person would have with other beings, as well as the
*more-than-human-world*, would be deeper by a great length. The empathic,
emotional, intellectual connections created would differ from those founded on
mutual benefit, instead of mutual interest. Where benefit differs from interest,
in that interest means being interest in a subject matter.

These inter-human connections would create a much stronger society, which would
show to have effects soon. These connections are much stronger nowadays compared
to a hundred years ago, given the means of connection, humans can have today,
compared to back then. The internet/machines of today and the *digital
connections* it creates of course differ from those in skin, though they are
valid, necessary and powerful *tools* to be used in making the idea reality.

The connections that can be created are more varied and more plenty and can be
stronger themselves than a hundred years ago, which is why this proposal only
works post-industrialisation, post-digitalisation et cetera. A society needs
connections and a better society should have better connections. Furthermore, a
more empathetic person can have a better connection/relationship with another
empathetic person, compared to two non-empathetic peers. 

### Earth

The earth is as we know in crisis and all this is done in mutual interest with
the earth and *man's* survival. The upper stage human would be a more caring
person, but also for the environment, in general, his surroundings. The
environment/surroundings one would find themself in, would matter to their every
breath and one would realise that and begin to align his interests with those
the environment has. \newline
The interests of a person can be changed easier than those of the planet, those
are nearly to all set in stone, the planet doesn't negotiate. 

The reality is, that the earth is finite and we require its resources, while it
requires us not to kill all life on it. These interests should be aligned.
Nowadays, with modern technology and the urgent need for change, this alignment
of interests could be pulled of. \newline
Solar, fusion, hydrogen, mostly all fronts of sciences have great opportunities
for change and alternatives. These are of course more expensive, but that can be
reasoned with. Additionally, the end-goal is, to have a society, that would
prefer the choice of more costly, but overall *better* material over cheap and
dirty, considering the breach of alignment of interests. \newline
The digital world is a reality, that is infinite in traditional measures to a
finite one like earth. This fact could be leveraged to support the lacks of a
finite planet. The *intention*/the reason for digitalism would be to support,
where the finite planet could be helped using it, while keeping its duty of
interconnectedness. 

### Tools

Tools allow the *Homo Faber* (Man the maker), to be as in *Arnold Gehlen's*
Theory of *"Man as an imperfect being"* and create/use tools to bend their
environment and nearly every other being on the planet to our will. These tools
can vary, they can be guns, hammers, scalpels, fridges, watches. But immaterial
*things* can also be tools. These also vary and could be kinship & empathy, hope
and fear, love and hate. It should come to attention, that these immaterial
tools differ clearly from those materialistic tools in that they address issues
that arise in higher stages of Maslow's hierarchy. \newline
Of course, hate arises in primitive cavemen, but again, the intention and
realisation of having these emotions and being able to use them as tools are
lacking. A gun may be useless when trying to achieve deeper relationships or
self-actualisation as a person, but it may still have value in aiding with
getting closer to that goal. \newline
Given the thought of the finite planet, the limits and restraints to the freedom
of humans are tight, especially compared to a digital simulation. The tools that
we use and have lie within these borders, but more importantly, we lie within as
well. Alike being in a bathtub, one cannot reach out for the door, unless
standing up. Thus, there are goals out of reach, put there out of reach, by our
dependency to the limited world we live in. \newline

> *Could a less limited world be created?*

The tools we have are astoundingly well diverse and greatly tuned towards
efficiently and effectively achieving what they are made for. With such amazing
tools, it should be possible to create value out of *nothing*. \newline

#### Theory of Emergence

In this theory, the properties of an accumulation/aggregation of parts can
differ from those that the constituent parts have on their own. \newline
Similar to the thought of, where is the soul, if all we are made of is atoms.
Isn't there something different to the accumulation of atoms that makes a
sentient human? (Quanta Magazine, 2019)

Given this theory, It can be seen that things can be created out of nothing.
That is the *how* the proposed society will live, based upon *emergence*. The
idea is, that automation manages the lower stage hierarchic needs, such as food
and therefore makes sure the human doesn't have to worry about that, but can
worry about their relationships, connections with other humans or the *more than
human world*. \newline
Alike the concept of socialism, there would be a universal provision of some
good, given to everyone equally. Though, the concept of capitalism is not
scrapped. The conceptual system that a society would be based on, would be a
fusion between democratic, socialism and capitalism. The concept of *basic
income* (About basic income, 2019), is what the closest real life equivalent
looks like. The system would be more equal, fair, have higher living standards
et cetera, but most importantly would be made out of humans that worry less
about primal things like food on the table or being able to take a shower.
\newline But instead worry more about how to make their neighbourhood community
a better place, how to be more successful in the job, wonder if the job is even
the correct one considering one's skills, et cetera. *That* would make the human
wonder more and more frequently *gaze up to the hevenly thinges*.

Farming can be automated, making food can be automated, the tools for that
exist. World hunger can be erased, the tools exist. They just need to be
energised from their potential state.

### Hope

The question of how these tools can be energised from their potential state and
be actively used, is in connection with hope and the other fires. Only with hope
can a tool become a means to an end. The hope origins in the moment of the
thought of the goal and no later. Henceforth, hope exists when ideas exist.
\newline
Hope can be aggregated and much more powerful that way, but still stay
potential, because it requires the necessary tools to achieve such hopes.
\newline
In fact, all fires in combination act when driving change. It is alike throwing
a pebble of a mountain cliff, it will for sure not arrive at the bottom alone,
it will tear other stones with it. Analogical for *kinship*, it is sometimes a
consequence as well as a reason. One may not someone else in better position to
drive change, thus kinship is the source of the change if realised. \newline
Empathy is a natural consequence of human nature and a human doesn't come more
empathic then when in hope. Seemingly it can be a tool as well, but empathy also
arises naturally in the envisioned society to a greater extent as is, thus
another multiplier effect to drive change. \newline
The earth is cradle of creation and place of piece of all our ideas and hopes,
even those hoping to be among the stars have to leave the earth first. The fires
are as interconnected, as the consequences of society itself. \newline
Society itself seems to consequentially, due to its nature be governed by the
*five fires*. 

They arise naturally within the interactions and go-alongs of everyday life.
Thus, one could say that the framework of *five fires for change* is
automatically in place in *some* way, for every society. The framework always
acts and reacts, the fires affect each other and become more or less dormant and
dominant. They push each other in the background temporarily, like when a crisis
tears the connections we have apart with some appalling new shock, just to be
grown over the next day or week. \newline
Society is dynamic, like fire and the framework keeps the balance between the
flames of the aspects within.


### Conclusion

The five fires for change framework has been identified to be deeply embedded
within society and can thus perfectly be leveraged for driving change within
said society. The goal is said to be moving society to a better, higher state in
Maslow's hierarchy of needs, thus the matchmaking of the framework for change
and the idea cooperate ideally. \newline
The idea for a better society turns out to require the framework and individuals
to become better themselves, so that as a result society becomes better. The
five fires provide a concrete framework that can be followed by the individual
of such society. Furthermore, it lays out cornerstones, dynamic aspects that can
be influenced within a society. \newline
Therefore, the proposal is being achieved on an individual level, it can be
promoted and organised/managed alike a movement, though every individual has to
apply and consider the fires for themselves. One can only show another the door,
not step through it for one.
