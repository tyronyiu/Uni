**35 word strategy statement**

Feeling at home where you stay is often not the case, the core values of Airbnb
work towards making sure you'd feel at home anywhere in the world. Airbnb tries
to ensure you can feel at home in other people's spaces.

**The three horizons of airbnb**

- offer bnb services online. Provide a platform for lender's and renter's needs.
- distinguish by making it more personal, better described and pictured, secure and thus more
  appealing. Local culture could be experienced more directly via host's
  recommendations or way of local living.
- Sharing culture / shared economy aspects brought and manifested in traditional
  industry, leading to an industry transformation.
