The gulf, northeast Asia and western Europe are regional groups of interest to
the united states. Some could say solely because of their economically and
industrially advancement and thus interest as trading partners.

Japan's occupation was made to be reshaping the country and its constitution to
disable a future imperialism to rise and try and conquer and expand. A
democratic form of constitution and changes in the education system were
examples of such.
Though, their reign and their ideas with *reshaping* the country diminished
quickly, even reverse out of intrusion. Their old system became quickly dominant
again, far opposite to Nazi Germany and their change. The reversal of decision
by the united states was due to the increasing count of war fronts to engage in
and the glooming cold war.
The change to the key that is held in the value of japans industrial power, is
due to the loyalty and responsibility that the employees hold in the company
they are working for. Instead of backing unions, after American occupation, the
labour force chose to support the company. That was also made possible by the
benefits received from supporting the company as an employee and the other way
around, in a quickly growing exporting industrial economy. The rebuilding done
by the united states have made it possible for japan to quickly become on of the
biggest economic powerhouses worldwide. Instead, like Rome and Constantinople,
completely demolishing the opponents economy and country and then take over, the
united states rebuilt and helped their former opponents in war very generously.
The comparison with japan and Germany lays that out clearly. To this day, the
Japanese have to bough to American will, which is the price to pay. US troops
have been stationed in japan ever since to keep things in check locally as well.
Even Obama and his government played "hard ball" with japan to change the
trajectory in which their politics were headed. Interestingly, the "freedom"
isn't completely restricted, their policymaking is theirs to control, within a
threshold range that would obviously be observed by the united states. Japan
exports a lot of goods to the united states, but not much the other way around,
which is a perfect example for said freedom. Though, as mentioned with the Obama
intervention, this privilege can also be said to be feared of being taken away.
The American security, support and trade partnership is something valuable to
both parties, but America will intervene to make their partners more like them.
As said relationship grows, America will over time call in favours in exchange
for their generosity.

Douglas MacArthur and the idea of cooping against the US regime and institute
imperialism. His actions are to be attributed to japans rebuilding process'
success. His ambitions were the reason for rumors for him trying to overthrow
the president.

MacArthur made Japan release the communist prisoners to be integrated into the
society again, which stopped internal conflicts between big conglomerate
industrial companies like Nissan or Mitsubishi and against the new regime.

Drafting the new constitution conflicts with the liberalism idea of making ones
own constitution, especially in case of a country that fought the British. The
question arising is whether democracy can be imposed from above. Opposing that
thought is that their freedom doesn't require people to die, thus fight for
their freedom, but receive it like a gift. (Those controlling the details hold
the power. -> MacArthur demanded the constitution to be written up in six days,
those who wrote it were the ones who *actually* controlled the trajectory for
japan. <- Also, MacArthur has already dismissed several drafts of constitutions,
so that thought only applies to an extent.)
The allowance for people to unionise and strike, is a literalistic appeal, but
strange to leave to reach by the Americans. (**The reverse course**

## Heartland alliances were not smooth

The American and European relationship is complicated. The allied forces did
behaved weird during war times which leads to social scepticism. The European
left has been a long standing hostility to the US, which eventually let to
intervention and 'imperialism' as can be observed with the 'Vietnam a
watershed'. An example is the middle class created by the war, which replaced a
prior existing, much greater gap between poor and rich. There was a clear
separation between starvation and obesity in British society prior to the war,
which was made shallower by having both camps come together to protect their
common country. The European allied forces and their sought for sovereignty as
well as geographic union is a good example of how these social changes and
social scepticism materialised. The french complaint at the American
scrutinisation made presented itself in a few ways, such as the creation of
"Europe" or the withdrawal of the military side from NATO. The European union
was the only way the french could imagine ever to become a world power again,
opposed the obeying nature the Americans would like them to adopt and wasn't
completely independent, thus could have and give support even in case of
military action. Also, as a union now, Germany and french have refused to
support US-British draw invasion. As known, the British-US relationship is
"special". "Americans are from mars, Europeans are from Venus"
