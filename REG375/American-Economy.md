# The peculiarities of American economic power

- Independence from England's emporium had to occur first.
- Although the fundings fathers' vision was merely different in few places from
  the British imperial system. 
- Liberals suspiciousness of the masses influenced the creation of the
  constitution to make it rather more conservative.
- Few threats were imminent once European powers have been pushed off; no entity
  on America would be able to be considered a threat. 
    - European forces efforts would be too great to be considered viable for
      invading the americas.
- Industrialisation brought by massive immigration to east coast cities.
    - Immigration argued with a *"better world concept"*
- 1980's US economy outstripped Britain and Germany, and population grew to 100
  million *(Germany: 80 million)*.
- After WWI (1920's), reparation triangle paid by Germany to France and Britain forwarded
  to the Americans, impoverishing Germany and giving opportunity for the rise of
  Hitler. 
- When US smashed Bretton/Woods system and American economic power was
  unrivaled, the strongest monetary system ever built got demolished.
    - only possible due to the demand of the dollar, fueled by national and
      international interest in the currency.

## Golan & Stokes: America's role in the world economy 

**Multilateralist**
- Global economic openenss
- Progressively liberalising the world economy
    - until Trump & selectively
- Most multilateralistic institutions in the world
- Provides for security for globalism 
- Reconstructing and promoting other nations economically after
  war/conflict.

**Mercantilism**
- Very selective pushing towads globalisation 
- America likes free trade when they think to be able to win..
- Selective protection and selective free trade isn't generally freedom.
- Clinton's stance *"manic mercantilism"* - David Rothkopf
- Why? - becaue everybody likes dollars
- Like paying your jailor as a inmate
- Being able to print dollars give america a unique unfair advantage
    - People have been complaining about it since the 1950's
    - *"exorbitant priviledge"*

**Primacy / World Empire**
- American has often not been liberal and selfish, while liberals could
  say that that is not the case, but merely staying afloat. 
- Americas global role does not benefit the US majorly, but it hasnt
  been narrowly nationalistic.  
- This is a state trying to far as to manage for global order. Its like
  rome. Although interest in new york or chicago, the interest is also
  greatly focused on other coasts and countries in the global age.
- The states argument is that they are not nationalistic, but global and
  that everybody should be served well instead of destroyed and taken
  over. "if you want to stay in kazahkstan, do so, but if you want to be
  global, you will have to deal with the united states"
- A very peculiar version of imperialism, the states are a country that is not
  being told what to do, but rather tells other countries what to do.
- What does a liberal government do? Serve the people! 
    - The states should serve other countries / the people if it sees itself as
      a global government.
- There is no system to hold this entity up to its word or control.
