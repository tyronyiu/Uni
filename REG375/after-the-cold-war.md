The surprising event of the collapse of the communism in the east.
The first peak of American power happened in 1945, whilst simply after the cold
war, it plateaued. The communist thread varnished, the American argument to
pretext the globe and lead to prosperity, went up in smoke with it. US
strategists resisted retrenchment, while advocates for or-back were labelled in
support of 'isolationism'. A new kind of thread, unilaterally aligned
against as a globe, should be the argument for involvement. The influence and
power of the states (like trump asking Ukraine to investigate Biden) even in
prosperous times.
After the break down of the communism, Bush senior needed to assure that it
wouldn't be able to be restored or altered. An installation of a *new world
order* was Bush's grand plan. It could also be labelled *community of nations to
deter aggression*. 
The need for one singular world order has become evident and defence as well of
promotion towards globalisation would seem to make a divergence not probable.
'New Military Humanism' was instated, and was the argument used against western
military intervention. Thus, anybody who didn't come to power through democratic
support, will not be of sovereignty and thus 'conditional sovereignty' was
coined.
