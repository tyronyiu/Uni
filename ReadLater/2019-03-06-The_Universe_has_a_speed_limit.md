# The Universe Has A Speed Limit, And It Isn’t The Speed Of Light

## Nothing can go faster than the speed of light in a vacuum. But particles in our
Universe can’t even go that fast.

*****

When it comes to speed limits, the ultimate one set by the laws of physics
themselves is the speed of light. As Albert Einstein first realized, everyone
looking at a light ray sees that it appears to move at the same speed,
regardless of whether it’s moving towards you or away from you. No matter how
fast you travel or in what direction, all light always moves at the same speed,
and this is true for all observers at all times. Moreover, anything that’s made
of matter can only approach, but never reach, the speed of light. If you don’t
have mass, you must move at the speed of light; if you do have mass, you can
never reach it.

But practically, in our Universe, there’s an even more restrictive speed limit
for matter, and it’s lower than the speed of light. Here’s the scientific story
of the real cosmic speed limit.

When scientists talk about the speed of light — 299,792,458 m/s — we implicitly
mean “the speed of light in a vacuum.” Only in the absence of particles, fields,
or a medium to travel through can we achieve this ultimate cosmic speed. Even at
that, it’s only the truly massless particles and waves that can achieve this
speed. This includes photons, gluons, and gravitational waves, but not anything
else we know of.

Quarks, leptons, neutrinos, and even the hypothesized dark matter all have
masses as a property inherent to them. Objects made out of these particles, like
protons, atoms, and human beings all have mass, too. As a result, they can
approach, but never reach, the speed of light in a vacuum. No matter how much
energy you put into them, the speed of light, even in a vacuum, will forever be
unattainable.

<span class="figcaption_hack">*The hyperdrive from Star Wars appears to depict an ultra-relativistic motion

relativity, you can never reach, much less exceed, the speed of light if you’re
made of matter.* (Jedimentat44 / flickr)</span>

But there’s no such thing, practically, as a perfect vacuum. Even in the deepest
abyss of intergalactic space, there are three things you absolutely cannot get
rid of.

1.  The WHIM: the warm-hot intergalactic medium. This tenuous, sparse plasma are the
leftovers from the cosmic web. While matter clumps into stars, galaxies, and
larger groupings, a fraction of that matter remains in the great voids of the
Universe. Starlight ionizes it, creating a plasma that may make up about 50% of
the total normal matter in the Universe.
1.  The CMB: the cosmic microwave background. This leftover bath of photons
originates from the Big Bang, where it was at extremely high energies. Even
today, at temperatures just 2.7 degrees above absolute zero, there are over 400
CMB photons per cubic centimeter of space.
1.  The CNB: the cosmic neutrino background. The Big Bang, in addition to photons,
creates a bath of neutrinos. Outnumbering protons by perhaps a billion to one,
many of these now-slow-moving particles fall into galaxies and clusters, but
many remain in intergalactic space as well.

<span class="figcaption_hack">*A multiwavelength view of the galactic center shows stars, gas, radiation and
black holes, among other sources. But the light coming from all of these
sources, from gamma rays to visible to radio light, can only indicate what our
instruments are sensitive enough to detect from 25,000+ light years away.

Any particle traveling through the Universe will encounter particles from the
WHIM, neutrinos from the CNB, and photons from the CMB. Even though they’re the
lowest-energy things, the CMB photons are the most numerous and
evenly-distributed particles of all. No matter how you’re generated or how much
energy you have, it’s not really possible to avoid interacting with this 13.8
billion year old radiation.

When we think about the highest-energy particles in the Universe — i.e., the
ones that will be moving the fastest — we fully expect they’ll be generated
under the most extreme conditions the Universe has to offer. That means we think
we’ll find them where energies are highest and fields are strongest: in the
vicinity of collapsed objects like neutron stars and black holes.

Neutron stars and black hole are where you can not only find the strongest
gravitational fields in the Universe, but — in theory — the strongest
electromagnetic fields, too. The extremely strong fields are generated by
charged particles, either on the surface of a neutron star or in the accretion
disk around a black hole, that move close to the speed of light. Moving charged
particles generate magnetic fields, and as particles move through these fields,
they accelerate.

This acceleration causes not only the emission of light of a myriad of
wavelengths, from X-rays down to radio waves, but also the fastest,
highest-energy particles ever seen: cosmic rays.

<span class="figcaption_hack">*Artist’s impression of the active galactic nucleus. The supermassive black hole
at the center of the accretion disk sends a narrow high-energy jet of matter
into space, perpendicular to the disc. A blazar about 4 billion light years away
is the origin of many of the highest-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos.* (DESY,
Science Communication Lab)</span>

Whereas the Large Hadron Collider accelerates particles here on Earth up to a
maximum velocity of 299,792,455 m/s, or 99.999999% the speed of light, cosmic
rays can smash that barrier. The highest-energy cosmic rays have approximately
36 million times the energy of the fastest protons ever created at the Large
Hadron Collider. Assuming that these cosmic rays are also made of protons gives
a speed of 299,792,457.99999999999992 m/s, which is extremely close to, but
still below, the speed of light in a vacuum.

There’s a very good reason that, by time we receive them, these cosmic rays
aren’t more energetic than this.

<span class="figcaption_hack">*The leftover glow from the Big Bang, the CMB, permeates the entire Universe. As
a particle flies through space, it is constantly being bombarded by CMB photons.
If the energy conditions are right, even the collision of a low-energy photon
like this has an opportunity to create new particles.* (ESA/Planck
Collaboration)</span>

The problem is that space isn’t a vacuum. In particular, the CMB will have its
photons collide and interact with these particles as they travel through the
Universe. No matter how high the energy is of the particle you made, it has to
pass through the radiation bath that’s left over from the Big Bang in order to
reach you.

Even though this radiation is incredibly cold, at an average temperature of some
2.725 Kelvin, the mean energy of each photon in there isn’t negligible; it’s
around 0.00023 electron-Volts. Even though that’s a tiny number, the cosmic rays
hitting it can be incredibly energetic. Every time a high-energy charged
particle interacts with a photon, it has the same possibility that all
interacting particles have: if it’s energetically allowed, by E=mc², then
there’s a chance it can create a new particle!

<span class="figcaption_hack">*Whenever two particles collide at high enough energies, they have the
opportunity to produce additional particle-antiparticle pairs, or new particles
as the laws of quantum physics allow. Einstein’s E = mc² is indiscriminate this
way. *(E. Siegel / Beyond The Galaxy)</span>

If you ever create a particle with energies in excess of 5 × 10¹⁹ eV, they can
only travel a few million light years — max — before one of these photons, left
over from the Big Bang, interacts with it. When that interaction occurs, there
will be enough energy to produce a neutral pion, which steals energy away from
the original cosmic ray.

The more energetic your particle is, the more likely you are to produce pions,
which you’ll continue to do until you fall below this theoretical cosmic energy
limit, known as the [GZK
cutoff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin_limit). (Named for
three physicists: Greisen, Zatsepin, and Kuzmin.) There’s even more braking
(Bremsstrahlung) radiation that arises from interactions with any particles in
the interstellar/intergalactic medium. Even lower-energy particles are subject
to it, and radiate energy away in droves as electron/positron pairs (and other
particles) are produced.

<span class="figcaption_hack">*Cosmic rays produced by high-energy astrophysics sources can reach Earth’s
surface. When a cosmic ray collides with a particle in Earth’s atmosphere, it
produces a shower of particles that we can detect with arrays on the ground. If
these particles are created beyond the local group, they should obey the GZK
cutoff.* (ASPERA collaboration / AStroParticle ERAnet)</span>

We believe that every charged particle in the cosmos — every cosmic ray, every
proton, every atomic nucleus — should limited by this speed. Not just the speed
of light, but a little bit lower, thanks to the leftover glow from the Big Bang
and the particles in the intergalactic medium. If we see anything that’s at a
higher energy, then it either means:

1.  particles at high energies might be playing by different rules than the ones we
presently think they do,
1.  they are being produced much closer than we think they are: within our own Local
Group or Milky Way, rather than these distant, extragalactic black holes,
1.  or they’re not protons at all, but composite nuclei.

The few particles we’ve seen that break the GZK barrier are indeed in excess of
5 × 10¹⁹ eV, in terms of energy, but do not exceed 3 × 10²¹ eV, which would be
the corresponding energy value for an iron nucleus. Since many of the
highest-energy cosmic rays have been confirmed to be heavy nuclei, rather than
individual protons, this reigns as the most likely explanation for the extreme
ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.

<span class="figcaption_hack">*The spectrum of cosmic rays. As we go to higher and higher energies, we find
fewer and fewer cosmic rays. We expected a complete cutoff at 5 x 10¹⁹ eV, but
see particles coming in with up to 10 times that energy.* (Hillas 2006 /
University of Hamburg)</span>

There is a speed limit to the particles that travel through the Universe, and it
isn’t the speed of light. Instead, it’s a value that’s very slightly lower,
dictated by the amount of energy in the leftover glow from the Big Bang. As the
Universe continues to expand and cool, that speed limit will slowly rise over
cosmic timescales, getting ever-closer to the speed of light. But remember, as
you travel through the Universe, if you go too fast, even the radiation left
over from the Big Bang can fry you. So long as you’re made of matter, there’s a
cosmic speed limit that you simply cannot overcome.
