I am no technophobe, but I do believe in living consciously … and technology has
a tendency to overrun our attention and our lives.

**It’s designed to do that: tech companies are motivated to keep our attention
in their apps, their websites, their devices. They’ve found incentives for us to
keep using the technology, shiny new things every second, powerful
recommendation engines, tapping into our desire not to miss out, to be
entertained, to run to comfort.**

But you know all that. The problem comes when we try to figure out how to get a
grip on it all, to tame technology to do what we need and then let it go so we
can be more present, go outside more, move more, be connected to each other in
real life more. Wrangling the chaos into something that we use consciously isn’t
always easy.

I propose simplicity. And the method I propose is limits.

This is nothing new — I’ve been an advocate of the simplicity of limits for well
over a decade, and many others have proposed simplicity and limits as well. It’s
a movement, if one that’s drowned out by technology.

But as with anything, we have to keep revisiting it. Keep coming back. Keep
reminding ourselves. Keep practicing.

Here’s the practice of simplicity through limits, as applied to technology:

1.  **Notice where it’s overrunning your life**. Where do you get caught in a loop
of watching videos or looking at people’s photos over and over, in a rabbithole
of reading social media or news sites, in response mode of checking messages
often and replying to everything right away? If you feel a bit addicted to
Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, Youtube, Netflix, Facebook, Messenger/Whatsapp or
the like … this is an area to apply a little focus. You might make a short list
of places to focus on. Add to this when you notice other areas overrunning your
attention.
1.  **Think of the simplicity that you’d like**. Are you happy with technology
filling up your attention as it is right now? If so, there’s no need to
simplify. But if you’d like to be more present, more connected to others, more
focused on your meaningful work, more active outside of technology … then ask
yourself how much you care about this. Are you really committed to change here,
or is it something you’ll just say you’re going to do? If you care about it,
visualize the simplicity you’d like here. What does that look like? What
benefits will it bring to your life?
1.  **Think of appropriate limits**. So let’s say you want to limit your time on
Instagram (let’s say it’s a big time suck for you) … one limit might be to not
check it on your phone (delete the app). And you decide to only look at it on
your web browser after 7pm. Now, these are just examples — the right limit is
one that feels workable for you, but that creates the amount of simplicity and
focus you’d like. I’ll give more specific ideas for limits below, but in this
step, you just choose the limit(s) that you think will work for you in each area
of technology.
1.  **Write the limits down & share it with one person**. Actually write down your
limits. For example, in a notebook, write, “I will only check Facebook once a
day, from 5–6pm.” Make a list of all of your limits in one place and share it
with someone, so you are committed to these limits.
1.  **Put the limits to the test**. Try these new limits for a week. Really commit
to it, don’t just say you’re going to do it. Feel committed to it in your heart.
Then actually try to stick to the limits. At the end of each day, reflect on how
it went … did you stick to the limits? What got in the way? See how it goes each
day for a week. This is the real-world test for the limits you’ve created.
1.  **Adjust as needed**. Do you need to change the limits in some way to make them
more doable? Or is there a way you can deepen your commitment? What reminders
can you set? What accountability can you create? How can you adjust your method?
Maybe other areas are coming up that you didn’t realize — reading blogs browsing
through certain websites, perhaps. Add these to your list, set limits. Adjust
each week.

That’s the general process … but let’s talk about some specific ideas.

### Simple Limits for the Phone

The phone is one of the biggest addictions for most people, because it has so
many other addictions inside of it! From Facebook and Instagram to news and
messages, it’s all there, anytime you get the itch.

Here are some ways you might limit your phone (pick and choose what would work
for you):

* **No phone use in the car, at the dining table, while in line, or while talking
with other people**. If you’re having coffee or lunch with someone, agree to put
the phones away unless you really, really need to look something up or put your
next date on the calendar. If you’re eating dinner with family, make the same
agreement. If you’re driving in the car (or riding with someone), tell yourself
that all messages and other stuff can wait until you get to your destination. If
you’re in line, there’s a strong tendency to fill the waiting by looking at
something on your phone or doing something useful … but cut that off and see if
you can just be present.
* **Delete the apps that are your biggest temptations**. I recently deleted all
social media, news and other distracting apps on my phone. Now I have Instapaper
and Kindle (for long-form reading), Whatsapp (for family messages), Todoist to
update my todo list, and some other as-needed apps (Chrome for looking things
up, some financial apps, and some travel apps). Having a phone without the
biggest temptations (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, etc.) will
drastically simplify your tech life.
* **Limit messaging to certain times, unless urgent**. I have given in to the
importance of messaging — I use Whatsapp for family, and Gmail and Slack for
work. But I also believe in limiting all of these, otherwise it’s constant
interruptions and responding to everyone else’s requests. Instead, I limit the
responding to certain times — email in the morning and late afternoon, and 1–2
times a day for messaging. I make an exception for urgent messages that need a
response sooner, which means I leave my notifications on so I can respond if
really needed. My family would love it if I responded more quickly, I know, but
setting limits means making tough decisions like this.

Imagine if you implemented limits like this — it would make most of our lives
simpler, and give us greater focus. And yes, it could be even simpler, but this
is what works for me right now.

### Simple Limits for the Computer

Many of us work online, in addition to finding news and entertainment on the
Internet. If you’re one of us, then you know how working and living online can
mean that your life becomes overtaken by technology.

But no matter your work situation, it’s likely that creating some limits can
simplify things.

Here are some ideas for setting limits and simplifying:

* **Set intentions & Most Important Tasks (MITs) as you start**. As you get
started for the day, instead of just diving in, take a minute to pick out your
1–3 Most Important Tasks for the day. Set an intention or two: to push into your
meaningful work, to be mindful throughout the day, to be loving to anyone you
message, etc. This creates a more intentional way of working. Now try to focus
first on your MITs.
* **Close tabs, do one task at a time**. Instead of having a thousand tabs open in
your browser, close them all but one. That means bookmarking the others to go to
later (maybe in a Later bookmark folder), maybe putting ones associated with
projects and tasks in your todo list (use a browser plugin to quick add your
tasks). Clear everything away, so you can have just one tab open to do your MIT
and have full focus.
* **Set a reminder & take breaks**. Use a [reminder extension like Break
Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/break-timer/hklkdbpicdmlpoiellngedpejjkmapei)
to remind you to take breaks and move around more often. Sitting too much isn’t
good for us! And setting limits for how long you sit at a time is a good way to
keep technology from overrunning our minds. As you return from each break, check
in with your intention — do you have a new intention? How are you doing with
your last intentions? Do you need to close tabs? What do you want to focus on
now?
* **Block distractions except during certain time boxes**. There are lots of site
blockers or Internet blockers ([here’s one for
Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji))
— just pick one. Think about what sites you’d like to limit. When do you want to
be able to use them? Perhaps you check news from 10–10:30 am, and go to your
distractions after 6pm. Set up those limits in your site blocker. That way you
can still have time with your distractions or information sources, but with
enforced limits.
* **Limit messaging, checking things, and random browsing**. Just like with the
phone, setting times when you do email or messaging is a good way to limit those
activities. You can do something similar with the things you need to check — set
times for when you check them. Or limit yourself to 5 minutes (set a timer in
the browser). Same thing with random browsing … if you want to allow yourself to
start reading about some fascinating new subject, set a timer. Or save the
articles for later (I use [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/), but there
are other good ones as well).

Of course, you don’t have to do all of these. You might have other ideas of
simplifying through limits. These are just some examples. But give some of them
a shot, and see if you can achieve greater simplicity through the power of
limits.
