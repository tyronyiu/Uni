## Notes

### debt capital

**Debt capital** is the **capital** that a business raises by taking out a loan. It is a loan made to a company that is normally repaid at some future date. ... This means that legally, the interest on **debt capital** must be repaid in full before any dividends are paid to any suppliers of equity.

### Ordinary shares

Ordinary shares, a synonym of common shares, represent the *basic voting shares* of a corporation. Holders of ordinary shares are typically entitled to one vote per share, and do not have any predetermined [dividend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) amounts. An ordinary share represents [equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp) ownership in a company proportionally with all other ordinary [shareholders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp), according to their percentage ownership in the company. All other shares of a company's stock are, by definition, preferred shares.

All corporations must have ordinary shares as part of their stock, as defined in their articles of association, and at least one ordinary share must be issued to a shareholder. In other words, someone has to be the owner of the corporation.

*While they face greater economic risk than creditors and preferred shareholders of a corporation, they can also reap greater rewards.*

If a company makes large profits, the creditors and preferred shareholders are not paid more than the fixed amounts to which they are entitled, while the ordinary shareholders divide the large profits among themselves. The same occurs when companies, such as start-ups, are sold to larger corporations. The ordinary shareholders usually profit the most.

The only obligation that an ordinary shareholder has is to pay the price of the share to the company when it is issued. In addition to the shareholder's right to residual profits, he is entitled to vote for the company's board members (although some preferred shareholders may also vote) and to receive and approve the company's annual financial statements.

### preference shares

Are shares of a company’s stock with dividends that are paid out to shareholders before common [stock dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp) are issued. If the company enters [bankruptcy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp), the shareholders with preferred stock are entitled to be paid from company assets first. Most preference shares have a fixed dividend, while common stocks generally do not. Preferred stock shareholders also typically do not hold any [voting rights](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/common_shareholder.asp), but [common shareholders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/votingright.asp) usually do.

Unlike common shares, preferreds also have a [callability](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/callablepreferredstock.asp) feature which gives the issuer the right to [redeem the shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/redemption.asp) from the market after a predetermined time. Investors buying preferred shares have a real opportunity for these shares to be called back at a redemption rate representing a significant premium over their purchase price. Markets for preferred shares often anticipate call backs and prices may be bid up accordingly.

Finally, preferred shares can be [converted](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convertible-security.asp) to a fixed number of common shares, but common shares don't have this benefit. Looking up a preferred stock's quote is as easy as looking up the quote for a common share.

Prices between ordinary shares and preference shares may vary and aren't necessary the same.

### To Sum Up

A good way to think of a preferred stock is as a security with characteristics somewhere in-between a [bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp) and a common stock.

### Gearing returns (leverage)

> Leverage is the [investment strategy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentstrategy.asp) of using borrowed money: specifically, the use of various [financial instruments](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstrument.asp) or [borrowed capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/borrowed-capital.asp) to increase the potential return of an investment. Leverage can also refer to the amount of [debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp) used to finance assets. When one refers to something (a company, a property or an investment) as "highly leveraged," it means that item has more debt than [equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp).Read more: [Leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp#ixzz5DKFm9cv1) <https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp#ixzz5DKFm9cv1> 
>

> Gearing refers to the level of a company’s debt related to its [equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp) capital, usually expressed in percentage form. It is a measure of a company’s financial [leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp) and shows the extent to which its operations are funded by [lenders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lender.asp) versus shareholders. The term "gearing" also refers to the ratio between a company’s stock price and the price of its [warrants](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warrant.asp).

### Forwards 

> A forward contract is a customized contract between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a specified price on a future date. A forward contract can be used for hedging or speculation, although its non-standardized nature makes it particularly apt for hedging. Unlike standard [futures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp) contracts, a forward contract can be customized to any commodity, amount and [delivery date](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deliverydate.asp). A forward contract settlement can occur on a cash or delivery basis. Forward contracts do not trade on a centralized exchange and are therefore regarded as over-the-counter (OTC) instruments. While their [OTC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) nature makes it easier to customize terms, the lack of a centralized clearinghouse also gives rise to a higher degree of [default risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrisk.asp). As a result, forward contracts are not as easily available to the [retail investor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retailinvestor.asp) as [futures contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp).

### Futures

> Futures are financial contracts obligating the buyer to purchase an [asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) or the [seller](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seller.asp) to sell an asset, such as a physical commodity or a [financial instrument](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstrument.asp), at a predetermined future date and price. Futures contracts detail the quality and quantity of the underlying asset; they are standardized to facilitate trading on a [futures exchange](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futuresexchange.asp). Some futures contracts may call for [physical delivery](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/physicaldelivery.asp) of the asset, while others are settled in cash.

> The [futures markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futuresmarket.asp) are characterized by the ability to use very high [leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp) relative to [stock markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp). Futures can be used to [hedge](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp) or speculate on the price movement of the underlying asset. For example, a producer of corn could use futures to lock in a certain price and reduce risk, or anybody could speculate on the price movement of corn by going long or short using futures.

> The long position, or buyer, agrees to purchase the underlying at a later date or at the expiration date at a price that is agreed to at the beginning of the transaction. Buyers benefit from price increases.

#### In Contrast

> A forward contract is a private transaction - a futures contract is not. Futures contracts are reported to the future's exchange, the clearing house and at least one regulatory agency. The price is recorded and available from pricing services.
>
> A future takes place on an organized exchange where the all of the contract's terms and conditions, except price, are formalized. Forwards are customized to meet the user's special needs. The future's standardization helps to create liquidity in the marketplace enabling participants to close out positions before expiration.
>
> Forwards have credit risk, but futures do not because a clearing house guarantees against default risk by taking both sides of the trade and marking to market their positions every night. Mark to market is the process of converting daily gains and losses into actual cash gains and losses each night. As one party loses on the trade the other party gains, and the clearing house moves the payments for the counterparty through this process.
>
> Forwards are basically unregulated, while future contract are regulated at the federal government level. The regulation is there to ensure that no manipulation occurs, that trades are reported in a timely manner and that the professionals in the market are qualified and honest.

### Intrinsic value

> The intrinsic value is the actual value of a company or an asset based on an underlying perception of its true value including all aspects of the business, in terms of both tangible and intangible factors. This value may or may not be the same as the [current market value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cmv.asp). Additionally, intrinsic value is primarily used in options pricing to indicate the amount an option is in the money.

> Follow us: [Investopedia on Facebook](https://ec.tynt.com/b/rf?id=arwjQmCEqr4l6Cadbi-bnq&u=Investopedia)

> Value investors who follow [fundamental analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/strike-price/) typically look at both qualitative (business model, governance and [target market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) factors) and quantitative (ratios and [financial statement analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp)) aspects of a business to see if the business is currently out of favor with the market and is really worth much more than its current [valuation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp). The discounted cash flow model is one commonly used valuation method used to determine a company's intrinsic value. The discounted cash flow model takes into account a company's free cash flow and weighted average cost of capital, which accounts for the time value of money.

### Time Value

> The time value of money (TVM) is the idea that money available at the present time is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential [earning capacity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earning-potential.asp). This core principle of [finance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/finance.asp) holds that, provided money can earn interest, any amount of money is worth more the sooner it is received. TVM is also sometimes referred to as present discounted value.

> Follow us: [Investopedia on Facebook](https://ec.tynt.com/b/rf?id=arwjQmCEqr4l6Cadbi-bnq&u=Investopedia)

> The time value of money draws from the idea that rational investors prefer to receive money today rather than the same amount of money in the future because of money's potential to grow in value over a given period of time. For example, money deposited into a [savings account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/savingsaccount.asp) earns a certain [interest rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp), and is therefore said to be compounding in value.

### In-The-Money

> In the money means that a call option's [strike price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp) is [below the market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/belowthemarket.asp) price of the [underlying asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-asset.asp) or that the strike price of a [put option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) is [above the market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/abovethemarket.asp) price of the underlying asset. Being in the money does not mean you will profit, it just means the option is worth exercising. This is because the option costs money to buy.

> Follow us: [Investopedia on Facebook](https://ec.tynt.com/b/rf?id=arwjQmCEqr4l6Cadbi-bnq&u=Investopedia)

> In the money means that your [stock option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockoption.asp) is worth money and you can turn around and sell or exercise it. For example, if John [buys](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buy.asp) a [call option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) on ABC stock with a strike price of $12, and the price of the stock is sitting at $15, the option is considered to be in the money. This is because the option gives John the right to buy the stock for $12 but he could immediately sell the stock for $15, a gain of $3. If John paid $3.50 for the call, then he wouldn't actually profit from the total trade, but it is still considered in the money.

### Out-The-Money

> Out of the money (OTM) is term used to describe a [call option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) with a [strike price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp) that is higher than the [market price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp) of the underlying asset, or a [put option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) with a strike price that is lower than the market price of the [underlying asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-asset.asp). An out of the money option has no [intrinsic value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp), but only possesses extrinsic or [time value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalue.asp).

### At-The-Money

> At the money is a situation where an option's [strike price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp) is identical to the price of the [underlying security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-security.asp). Both call and put options are simultaneously at the money. For example, if XYZ stock is trading at 75, then the XYZ 75 [call option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) is at the money and so is the XYZ 75 [put option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp). An at-the-money option has no intrinsic value, but it may still have [time value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalue.asp). Options trading activity tends to be high when options are at the money.

#### Contrasting In-The-Money, At-The-Money, Out-The-Money

> Options are classified in three ways depending on the relationship of the strike price to the security's market price. In the money means the strike price is lower, in the case of a call, or higher, in the case of a put, than the market price. At the money means the strike price and market price are the same. 
>
> The amount of the premium paid for an option depends in large part on whether the option is in the money, at the money or [out of the money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp). Because they have intrinsic value, in the money options are the most expensive. Out of the money options, which require a price movement to become valuable, cost much less.

> The other two are in the money, meaning the option has some intrinsic value, and out of the money, meaning the option has no [intrinsic value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp). The intrinsic value for a call option is calculated by subtracting the strike price from the underlying security's current price. The intrinsic value for a put option is calculated by subtracting the underlying asset's current price from its strike price.

### Payback Period

$$
PP = \frac{\text{years full recovery + unrecovered cost at beginning of last year}}{\text{cash flow in following year}}
$$

> The payback period is the length of time required to recover the cost of an investment. The payback period of a given investment or project is an important determinant of whether to undertake the position or project, as longer payback periods are typically not desirable for investment positions. The payback period ignores the time value of money (TVM), unlike other methods of capital budgeting such as [net present value (NPV)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp), [internal rate of return (IRR),](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irr.asp) and [discounted cash flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp).

One of the most important concepts that every corporate financial analyst must learn is how to value different investments or operational projects. The analyst must find a reliable way to determine the most profitable project or investment to undertake. One way corporate financial analysts do this is with the payback period.

### Discounted Payback Period

$$
DPP = \frac{\text{Initial Cash Outlay}}{\text{Discounted Annual Cash Flow}}
$$

> The discounted payback period is a [capital budgeting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalbudgeting.asp) procedure used to determine the profitability of a project. A discounted [payback period](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paybackperiod.asp) gives the number of years it takes to break even from undertaking the initial expenditure, by discounting future [cash flows](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp) and recognizing the [time value of money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp). The [net present value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp) aspect of the discounted payback period does not exist in a [payback period](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/payback-period/)in which the gross inflow of future [cash flows](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/what-is-cash-flow/) are not discounted.

> The general rule for the calculation is to accept projects that result in a discounted payback period that is less than the targeted period. A company is able to compare its required break-even date to when the project will break even in terms of discounted cash flows, to approve or reject the project.

#### Payback Period vs. Discounted Payback Period

> The payback period is the amount of time for a project to break even in cash collections using nominal dollars. Alternatively, the discounted payback period reflects the amount of time necessary to break even in a project based not only on what cash flows occur, but when they occur and the prevailing rate of return in the market. These two calculations, although similar, may not return the same result due to discounting of cash flows. For example, projects with higher cash flows toward the end of the project life will experience greater discounting due to compound interest. For this reason, the payback period may return a positive figure, while the discounted payback period returns a negative figure.

### NPV

<div style="text-align: center;">
$$
NPV = \sum_{T=1}^{T}\frac{C_t}{(1+r)^t}-C_o
$$
Where 

$$C_t = \text{net cash inflow during period t}$$

$$C_o = \text{total investment cost}$$

$$r = \text{discount rate}$$

$$t = \text{number of time periods}$$

</div>

> Net present value (NPV) is the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over a period of time. NPV is used in [capital budgeting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalbudgeting.asp) to analyze the profitability of a projected investment or project.

> A positive net present value indicates that the projected earnings generated by a project or investment (in present dollars) exceeds the anticipated costs (also in present dollars). Generally, an investment with a positive NPV will be profitable, and an investment with a negative NPV will result in a net loss. This concept is the basis for the [Net Present Value Rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv-rule.asp), which dictates that the only investments that should be made are those with positive NPV values.

> When the investment in question is an acquisition or a merger, one might also use the [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) metric.

> Determining the value of a project is challenging because there are different ways to measure the value of future cash flows. Because of the [time value of money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp), money in the present is worth more than the same amount in the future. This is both because of earnings that could potentially be made using the money during the intervening time and because of inflation. In other words, a dollar earned in the future won’t be worth as much as one earned in the present. The discount rate element of the NPV formula is a way to account for this.
>
> Companies often have different ways of identifying the discount rate. Common methods for determining the discount rate include using the expected return of other investment choices with a similar level of risk (rates of return investors will expect), or the costs associated with borrowing money needed to finance the project.

> Follow us: [Investopedia on Facebook](https://ec.tynt.com/b/rf?id=arwjQmCEqr4l6Cadbi-bnq&u=Investopedia)

> A ratio of 1.0 is logically the lowest acceptable measure on the index, as any value lower than 1.0 would indicate that the project's [PV](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presentvalue.asp) is less than the initial investment. As values on the [profitability index](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/index/) increase, so does the financial attractiveness of the proposed project.

> Profitability index is an appraisal technique applied to potential capital outlays. The technique divides the projected capital inflow by the projected [capital outflow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-outflow.asp) to determine the profitability of a project. The main feature of using profitability index is the technique disregards project size. Therefore, projects with larger cash inflows may result in lower profitability index calculations because their [profit margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profitmargin.asp) is not as high.

### IRR


$$
NPV \text{ Formula = 0, solve for discount rate }r \text{ which is the IRR}
$$
To calculate IRR using the formula, one would set NPV equal to zero and solve for the discount rate (r), which is the IRR. Because of the nature of the formula, however, IRR cannot be calculated analytically and must instead be calculated either through trial-and-error or using software programmed to calculate IRR.

> Internal rate of return (IRR) is a metric used in [capital budgeting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalbudgeting.asp) to estimate the profitability of potential investments. Internal rate of return is a [discount rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp) that makes the [net present value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp) (NPV) of all cash flows from a particular project equal to zero. IRR calculations rely on the same formula as NPV does.
>
> Read more: [Internal Rate Of Return (IRR) Definition | Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irr.asp#ixzz5DKJC1AA1) <https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irr.asp#ixzz5DKJC1AA1> 
> Follow us: [Investopedia on Facebook](https://ec.tynt.com/b/rf?id=arwjQmCEqr4l6Cadbi-bnq&u=Investopedia)

> Generally speaking, the higher a project's internal rate of return, the more desirable it is to undertake. IRR is uniform for investments of varying types and, as such, IRR can be used to rank multiple prospective projects on a relatively even basis. Assuming the costs of investment are equal among the various projects, the project with the highest IRR would probably be considered the best and be undertaken first.
>
> IRR is sometimes referred to as "economic rate of return" or "discounted cash flow rate of return." The use of "internal" refers to the omission of external factors, such as the cost of capital or inflation, from the calculation.
>

> Follow us: [Investopedia on Facebook](https://ec.tynt.com/b/rf?id=arwjQmCEqr4l6Cadbi-bnq&u=Investopedia)

> You can think of internal rate of return as the rate of growth a project is expected to generate. While the actual rate of return that a given project ends up generating will often differ from its estimated IRR, a project with a substantially higher IRR value than other available options would still provide a much better chance of strong growth. One popular use of IRR is comparing the profitability of establishing new operations with that of expanding existing ones. For example, an energy company may use IRR in deciding whether to open a new power plant or to renovate and expand a previously existing one. While both projects are likely to add value to the company, it is likely that one will be the more logical decision as prescribed by IRR.

> While IRR is a very popular metric in estimating a project’s profitability, it can be misleading if used alone. Depending on the initial investment costs, a project may have a low IRR but a high NPV, meaning that while the pace at which the company sees returns on that project may be slow, the project may also be adding a great deal of overall value to the company.
>
> A similar issue arises when using IRR to compare projects of different lengths. For example, a project of a short duration may have a high IRR, making it appear to be an excellent investment, but may also have a low NPV. Conversely, a longer project may have a low IRR, earning returns slowly and steadily, but may add a large amount of value to the company over time.

> In theory, any project with an IRR greater than its cost of capital is a profitable one, and thus it is in a company’s interest to undertake such projects. In planning investment projects, firms will often establish a [required rate of return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredrateofreturn.asp) (RRR) to determine the minimum acceptable return percentage that the investment in question must earn in order to be worthwhile. Any project with an IRR that exceeds the RRR will likely be deemed a profitable one, although companies will not necessarily pursue a project on this basis alone. Rather, they will likely pursue projects with the highest difference between IRR and RRR, as these likely will be the most profitable.
>
> IRR can also be compared against prevailing rates of return in the securities market. If a firm can't find any projects with IRR greater than the returns that can be generated in the financial markets, it may simply choose to invest its retained earnings into the market.
>
> Although IRR is an appealing metric to many, it should always be used in conjunction with NPV for a clearer picture of the value represented by a potential project a firm may undertake.

### MIRR


$$
MIRR = \sqrt[n]{\frac{FV\text{(Positive Cash Flows/Cost Of Capital)}}{PV\text{(Initial Outlays/Financing Cost)}}}-1
$$


> Modified internal rate of return (MIRR) assumes that positive cash flows are reinvested at the firm's cost of capital, and the initial outlays are financed at the firm's financing cost. By contrast, the traditional [internal rate of return (IRR)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irr.asp) assumes the [cash flows](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp) from a project are reinvested at the IRR. The MIRR more accurately reflects the cost and profitability of a project.

> Follow us: [Investopedia on Facebook](https://ec.tynt.com/b/rf?id=arwjQmCEqr4l6Cadbi-bnq&u=Investopedia)

> The MIRR is used to rank investments or projects of unequal size. The calculation is a solution to two major problems that exist with the popular IRR calculation. The first main problem with IRR is that multiple solutions can be found for the same project. The second problem is that the assumption that positive cash flows are reinvested at the IRR is considered impractical in practice. With the MIRR, only a single solution exists for a given project, and reinvestment rate of positive cash flows is much more valid in practice.

### Strict Capital rationing

> Capital rationing is the act of placing restrictions on the amount of new investments or projects undertaken by a company. This is accomplished by imposing a higher [cost of capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcapital.asp) for investment consideration or by setting a ceiling on specific portions of a budget. Companies may want to implement capital [rationing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rationing.asp) in situations where past returns of an investment were lower than expected.
>

> Follow us: [Investopedia on Facebook](https://ec.tynt.com/b/rf?id=arwjQmCEqr4l6Cadbi-bnq&u=Investopedia)

> Capital rationing is essentially a management approach to allocating available funds across multiple investment opportunities, increasing a company's bottom line. The combination of projects with the highest total net present value (NPV) is accepted by the company. The number one goal of capital rationing is to ensure that a company does not over-invest in assets. Without adequate rationing, a company might start realizing decreasingly low returns on investments, and may even face financial insolvency.

> **Two Types of Capital Rationing**
>
> The first type of capital rationing is referred to as "hard capital rationing." This occurs when a company has issues raising additional funds, either through equity or debt. The rationing arises from an external need to reduce spending, and can lead to a shortage of capital to finance future projects.
>
> The second type of rationing is called "soft capital rationing," or internal rationing. This type of rationing comes about due to the internal policies of a company. A fiscally conservative company, for example, may have a high required return on capital in order to accept a project, self-imposing its own capital rationing.

### EAA

> The equivalent annual annuity approach (EAA) is one of two methods used in [capital budgeting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalbudgeting.asp) to compare mutually exclusive projects with unequal lives. The equivalent annual annuity (EAA) approach calculates the constant annual cash flow generated by a project over its lifespan if it was an annuity. When used to compare projects with unequal lives, the one with the higher EAA should be selected.

> Follow us: [Investopedia on Facebook](https://ec.tynt.com/b/rf?id=arwjQmCEqr4l6Cadbi-bnq&u=Investopedia)

> The EAA approach uses a three-step process to compare projects. The present value of the constant annual cash flows is exactly equal to the project's [net present value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp) (NPV). The first thing an analyst does is calculate each project's NPV over its lifetime. After that, he computes each project's EAA so that the present value of the annuities is exactly equal to the project's NPV. Lastly, the analyst compares each project's EAA and selects the one with the highest EAA.
