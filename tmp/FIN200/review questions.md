### Q1

Assume that a company has 5m in capital and 4m in debt. The annual interest rate for the debt is 8%. Tax rate is 20%. EBIT for the year is $800,000. Calculate the **interest payment, tax and net profit.** Also calculate **ROCE** (return on capital employed) and **ROE** (return on equity) and comment on the effect of leverage.

Given: 

5,000,000 in Capital

4,000,000 in debt

I for debt = 0.08

Tax I = 0.2

EBIT = 800,000

Interest payment = (4,000,000 * (1+(i * n))) = **320,000**

EBT = 800,000 - 320,000 = 480,000

Tax payment = EBT * Tax = 480,000 * 0.2 = 96,000

EAIT = 480,000 - 96,000 = 384,000

ROE = Net profit after tax / equity capital = 0.0768 -> 7.68%

ROCE = earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) / Equity + debt = 0.0888…. -> 8.89% 



### Q2

Calculate the present value of an annuity which pays £10 for 5 years, where the discount rate is 8% per annum. What would be the present value if it was a perpetuity instead of an annuity?

Given:

A = 10

N = 5

i = 0.08

 *Annuity PV*	PV = ((1 - ( 1 / ( 1 + I ) ^ n )) / I ) * A = 39.93

*Perpetuity PV*		PV= ( A / I ) = 125



### Q3

Calculate the discount rate and bond equivalent rate for a UK 6 month Treasury bill which sells for 98.2746. (183/365)

Given:

N = 6 months = 183/365

P = 98.2746

Discount yield = (( FV - PV ) / FV ) * ( days in year / days to maturity ) * 100 = 3.44137158469944 = 3.44 %

BEY =  (( FV -PV ) / PV ) * (days in year / days to maturity) * 100 = 3.5017914951568767 = 3.50 %



### Q4

A £50,000 3-month CD is issued at 0.98 per cent annual interest rate.

a) How much will the owner receive at maturity (91/365 days)?

b) If the CD is sold to a second investor with 28 days to maturity, and the annual rate of interest on a 28-day CD is 0.84 per cent at the time, how much would the second investor pay for the CD?

Given:

FV = 50,000

N = 91/365

I = 0.98

a)

FV + ( FV * ( I / 100 ) * ( 91 / 365 )) = 50122.16438356164 = 50122.16

b)

N = 28/365

I = 0.84

FV + ( FV * ( I / 100 ) * ( 28 / 365 )) = 50032.21917808219 = 50032.22



### Q5

5,000 worth of 3 months US Treasury bills with a quoted yield per annum of 0.46 per cent are bought in the secondary market. How much would you pay if the bills mature in 16 days? Use the actual/360 day count convention.

Given:

FV = 5,000

i = 0.46

N = 16/360

( FV * ( I / 100 ) * ( 16/ 360 )) = 1.0222222222222224

P = FV - Discount = 5000 - 1.0222222222222224 = 4998.977777777778 = 4998.98 

### Q6

What is the market price of a plain vanilla bond with an annual coupon of 6 per cent and maturity of 6 years if yield to maturity for securities of same maturity and risk are:

Given:

Coupon = 0.06

N = 6 years 

YTM = 0.04 || 0.08

a) 4%?

110.48

b) 8%?

90.75



### Q7

An investor buys a 5 year index-linked gilt with a stated coupon rate of 2%. If the Retail Price Index increases by 15% during the 5 years, calculate the value of the last coupon and the par value at maturity?

Given:

N = 5 years

Coupon rate = 0.02

Increase in I = 0.15

Coupon = interest = P * ( 1 + I ) = 114.99999999999999 = 115

Par Value = Coupon * interest rate = 115 * 0.02 = 2.3



### Q8

A £100 convertible bond has a conversion price of £4 per share. The current share price is £3. Calculate the conversion ratio and the conversion premium.

Given:

P = 100

Conversion price = 4

Current share price = 3

Conversion ratio = 100 / 4 = 25

Conversion premium = (( 4 - 3) / 3) * 100 = 1 / 3 * 100 = 33.33



### Q9

What would be the price of a bond with annual coupons of 4.5 per cent and 4 years to maturity if the market rate for this type of security (i.e. required rate of return) is 3 per cent?

Given: 

Coupon = 0.045

N = 4

I = 0.03

((1 - ( 1 / ( 1 + I ) ^ n )) / I ) * A + ( F / ( 1 + I ) ^n) = 105.57564760421556 = 105.58



### Q10

What is the current yield and yield to maturity of a bond with annual coupons of 3.5 per cent at 5 years to maturity currently trading at 102.5 per cent to its face value.

Given:

Coupon = 0.035

N = 5

P = 102.5

Current yield = Coupon / price = 3.5 / 102.5 = 0.03414634146341464 = 3.41%

YTM = 0.034 + ((( 100 - 102.5) / 5) / 102.5) = 0.029121951219512197 = 2.91%



## Past paper

### Q11

A £90,000 CD is issued on 15 August for three months at 1.12 (expressed as anannual rate).

1. How much will the bank pay the holder of the CD at maturity? (assuming thatthere are 91 days in 3 months and 365 days in a year).


2. If the CD is sold to another investor with 41 days to maturity, and the annual rates of interest on 41-day CDs are 1.09 at the time, how much would the buyer pay for it?

Given:

FV = 90,000

N = 91/365

I = 1.12



1.

 FV + ( FV * ( I / 100 ) * ( 91/ 360 )) = 90251.30958904109 = 90251.31



2.

PV = ( FV ) / ( 1 + (( I / 100 ) * ( 41 / 365) )) = ( 90251.31 ) / ( 1 + (( 0.0109 / 100 ) * ( 41 / 365) ))

= 90250.20499132574



### Q12

Given:

Coupon = 0.055 

N = 6

Price = 103 % == 1.03



Current yield = coupon / price =  5.5 / 103 = 0.05339805825242718 = 5.34 %

YTM = ( Coupon / price ) + (((F - P) / n ) / P ) = 0.04854368932038835 = 4.85 %



### Q13

An index-linked gilt with maturity of 8 years has a par value of £100 and a stated coupon rate of 4%. If the Retail Price Index (inflation) increases by 25% throughout this 8 year period, what would be the value of:

1. the payout at maturity (par value)?
2. the last coupon?

Given:

N = 8

Par = 100

Coupon = 0.04 == 4%

Increase = 25 % == 0.25

Value at Maturity = 100 + (100 * 0.25) = 125

Last coupon = 4 + increase, where increase = 4 * 0.25 == 1 

= 4 + 1 = 5
