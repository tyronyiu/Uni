**Exploring Self and Society Work**

When I left Hamburg and went to St. Andrews for boarding school, I believed I was very efficient with my studying and knew all the methods of memorizing definitions and concepts needed for the IB.
I didn't listen when teachers introduced me to new forms of learning and spent day in and out studying with the study method I felt most comfortable with.
This worked out well in the beginning, so I stuck with it, however as the amount of studying needed increased I felt burnt out quickly.
I was so convinced I had found the perfect methods for success in studying, that I had hindered myself from growing and becoming more efficient.
This is a mindset, known as a *fixed mindset*. As I believed, that my methods were superior, resulted in me ignoring the introduction to new forms.
A fixed mindset means, that one is not able to explore new ways, because they're unable to recognise these opportunities in the first place. This may have lead, to me having the feeling that the IB was not giving me the opportunity to invest any time into my social life.
As this increased I also increasingly began trying and adapting a growth mindset, meaning I looked for methods which were more efficient than mine, by asking fellow pupils and teachers for advice on how to work more efficiently.
At this point, I was introduced to a form of studying called *hollistic learning* with which you use imagery to memorize concepts quicker and to remember them in the long-term, as it is related to personal experience.
This changed my mindset once and for all.
I realized that I had lost so much time through studying the way I was used to. My fixed mindset decreased my efficiency and wasted my time.
My growth mindset had helped me to increase the efficiency of my studying as I now adapted to working with hollistic learning methods and saving an extensive amount of time.
If I would have kept a fixed mindset, I would not have had the opportunity to grow as an individual, would have spent a lot more time doing things I didn't really wanted to do at the time and would have not reached my potential in graduating the IB.
Overall, a growth mindset had taught me to stay humble, to look out and be open for new experiences, as the world is full of knowledge and any human can grow to become better and more efficient, using a growth mindset.
As I was now interested, I believed there must be various other study methods which would make me even more efficient in my routines of studying.
I found that concepts like the *Zeigarnik Effect*, *Memory Palaces* or *learning by teaching* would help me become more efficient in studying and generally in life.
My growth mindset helped me, to become more efficient in studying and led to me finding new ways of reaching my potential, in a wide range of different life aspects.
