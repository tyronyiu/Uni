*Reciprocity* - I scratch your back, your scratch mine. Responding to a positive action by another.
*Scarcity* - Lack of availability of something. The less there is of something, the more people want more of it.
*Cognitive dissonance* - Doing something against the majority's will through e.g. a moral.

*Bargaining* or _haggling_ is a type of negotiation in which the buyer and seller of a good dispute the price which will be paid and the exact nature of the transaction that will take place and come to an agreement. Bargaining is an alternative pricing strategy to fixed prices.

*A few thoughts for Effective Negotiations* - _Fisher, Ury, Patton (2015)_

  * risk of shabby agreements
  * Determinate [[BATNA]]
  * Separate the people from the problem
    - Human beings don't communicate clearly and they mix their egos with their positions. Attack the problem instead of people. 
  * Focus on interests, not positions
  * Generate a variety of possibilities before deciding what to do
   
*Objective standards*   

Some people can get what they want by simply being stubborn.
Counter these by insisting that:
  * A single voice is not enough
  * Demand the agreement reflects a fair _objective criteria_ independent from each side's mere desires.
  * Base the terms on unbiased standards such as market value, expert opinion, custom or law.
   
  * *P*eople
  * *I*nterests
  * *O*ptions
  * *S*tandards

*Strategic Moves*

  * Control
  * Incentives
  * Support
  * Pressure
  * Authority
   
Support example for _strategic moves_:

*SME* - Subject matter expert

Market qualifiers are aspect that qualify a party to become part of a given market. They are things, that without which, one is not qualified for the market.

*The Frame* - The way you package and present your proposal - matters as much as its substance. Framing is powerful because it allows you to make proposals that are basically the same "more or less attractive simply by how you present them."

Framing can mitigate two problems that frequently drag down negotiations.

*Framing in Decision Making*

  * Social Proof
  * Default Option
  * The Reference Point
   
*The power of process*

  * Power of "process"
  * Threats to "process"
  * The power of "empathy"
