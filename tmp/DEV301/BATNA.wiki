= BATNA - Best alternative to a negotiated agreement =

Measure any proposed agreement against this standard.
It will protect you from accepting a very bad agreement and keep you from rejecting an agreement that is in your interest.

List all alternatives and select the preferred one. 

Example alternatives of a BATNA analysis:
  * Sell for price I want
  * not sell
  * rent out
  * demolish & build new
  * accept new price
   
*What can go wrong without a BATNA?*   

Alternatives should not be seen as an aggregate.
Negotiating without BATNA is like having your eyes closed.

*Developing your BATNA*

  1. Invent a list of actions you might take if no agreement is reached,
  2. Improve the ideas with the most potential and convert them into practical alternatives.
  3. Tentatively select the best alternative.

_Developing your BATNA thus not only enables you to determinate what is a minimally acceptable agreement. It will probably raise that minimum._ - Getting to Yes, R. Fisher & W. Ury
