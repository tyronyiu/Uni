BATNA

movement only for generous gifting


**Different energy sources?**

* Nuclear
* Geothermal
* Solar
* Wind
* Hydro

Dam maintenance ~1bn per year 


## Proposal #1
build dam
Fund complete reset of ecosystem where lake would be. 
100m per year (from revenue of dam to eco system fund)


## Proposal #2
smaller dam (instead of flooding 600km^2 reduce to half or three-quarters)
reduces entire dam impact
add wind+solar for diversified portfolio

##Proposal #3

Wind energy not an option (wind takes a long time to build)
Dam proposal not just a social or energy project, but economical


gov willing to remove and rebuild heritage site and build museum - actually ok for people, heritage is being honored

infrastructure needs to be built, decentralised version?
moving support?
work for people at dam while building


what if something breaks?
Alternative/backups would be great


## Proposal #4
smaller dam
no financial compensation
no museum/heritage 
less than 100m in investment per year as ecological impact is less
  proportionate reduction
relocation/care for jobs covered 
option to buy land cheap somewhere else
subvention of agricultural industries
