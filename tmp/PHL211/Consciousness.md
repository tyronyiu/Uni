### Maximising life

Most ethical principles (Deontology, liberty, utility, happiness) define their principle broadly and applicable, non-specific. This is due to the difficulties of measuring states of consciousness of non-self living organisms.

> The happiness/liberty/consequence/nature of action of a dog relative to a human is regarded as the same.

The problem with the example given is that while covering all living organisms due to the fact of being alive, their consciousness, mind, body etc. are unique yet only a pattern of the same underlying fabric. The problems with combining principles are the non-differentiation between life and the aspirations of such.

While nature, source etc. of life remains unknown, the consequences of life on non-living entities are clearly to be differentiated from living entities, which **leaves no option for not differentiating between living entities within living entities & non-living entities within non-living entities.**

> From a biological point of view, there are only two options that life itself ( where the choice of life is interpreted as the feedback loop a cell creates) can pursue, which are *self-sustainability* or *reproduction*.

To clear the meaning behind feedback loops, imagine a stone, an alligator a monkey and a human. The stone as level one, only existing (as non-living, non-aware and non-comprehendible of relation to space). Only very few if any feedback loops exist for the stone entity. The alligator needs to have a certain number of feedback loops to understand its placement within space but also its relation to every other entity it regards as considerable. The monkey adds on top the comprehension of emotion and social hierarchy (level two just like the alligator, but by IQ being measurable one can differentiate clearly and on many levels between alligator and monkey). The human now, is able to understand time and thus predicts and models about time and future developments. The number of feedback loops increased strongly from stone to alligator and alligator to monkey but the difference in the number of feedback loops between any of them and a human is dramatic. A feedback loop is always instantiated when creating (imagining or predicting or any other appropriate word for making up the future) a possibility of any future. As time is indefinite the number of feedback loops has a major milestone at level three.

Knowledge, memory, the brain, how it functions etc. is not everything which seems to define life. In fact, for over hundreds of years concepts of the human body and mind being separate entities have existed. By introducing the brain, cells, neurones etc, the body part of the complete definition of a living entity can be sub-divided into a physical representation and non-physical representation, where the second aspect describes memory, pathways and patterns in the neural network created by passing on information through genetics, experience, culture etc.

We can measure and map neural paths, feedback loops, the arrangement of atoms in a body to recreate it. The two subdivisions of the living entity's component are measurable and hence no problem. Living entities can thus be theoretically be cloned, teleported, transferred between physical representations and other cool stuff, and also simulations can be made with the character of that entity, how that person would behave based upon memory etc. in a certain situation. "Minority report", mind reading, all that is possible theoretically, if there weren't the fact that things change (and *things* include the consciousness of a living entity). Ultimately, Living entities can be put into drawers based upon IQ, experience, memory, physical appearance and intertwined, but something is missing.

The image of a living organism having an un-definable component makes it hard to differentiate. But not definable does not exclude measurable.

> A human understands easier certain concepts than a dog. Why? One may say IQ, and that is of course true, but only to the measurable extent of its behaviour.

I would try to define the consciousness of an entity as *the number of feedback loops available to the entity and its awareness of such*.

> To ease understanding, robots nowadays are classified as on a level with insects in form of intelligence, and it that sense intelligence can also be seen as commonly perceived as the capability of exploiting the feedback loops available, but does not concern about the Total number of them.

If you consolidate the definition of existing as the ability to perceive as a conscious entity. One can hence say that nothing exists without any entity perceiving. Also important to remember is, that *time* enables existence itself.

> Robots and insects exist and are living entities. They are aware of themselves and their relation to themselves and their environment. They achieve level two consciousness.

### **Levels of consciousness**

Is a rock conscious? The answer is not necessarily no. A rock exists and has some intelligence. It responds to physical stimuli with its physical structure doesn't it, but is definitely not aware of its placement within any fabric or even other entities.

The first level of consciousness is thus existence itself, which can only occur to entities, not non-entities.

The second level of consciousness is thus the comprehension of the relation to space and other entities. (When relating to space a relation to time is always made). The comprehension of time is not conscious at this level though, the relation of time is indirect and occurring by means of comprehending space itself. E.g. when calculating the distance between objects in an instance no time is necessary because no relations between entities in space change, but reality changes and to calculate when an alligator needs to leap forwards to catch its prey, does not require the alligator to have a clear concept of time, but only that space changes.

The third level of consciousness is thus the comprehension of time. Future present and past are merely interchangeable. Ants or monkey have both great perception and understanding of their relation to space by showing the ability of movement (nothing moves without comprehending relations in space) and the relation to other entities by showing the creation of complex social hierarchies, teamwork, coordination etc. But they as well lack a clear understanding of time. Ants do not plan into the future by predicting changes that could occur. Animals in the second level seem to by stocking up for winter or similar, but these are solely made from memory of heavy patterns, not on coherent predictions made based upon past experiences and present circumstances and/or abstraction.

**Too long didn't read (TL;DR)**

There are three distinct levels of consciousness.

The consciousness of living entities may now be classified and differently treated.

Therefore, ethical and philosophical concepts may be more reliable and more applicable as well as precise.

> E.g. no assurances to a level two entity about the future have to ever be made.
>
> E.g. level one entities' relativity with other entities is negligible, hence an individual entity does not affect the whole.

**What's the meaning?**

Now, the classification between consciousness can be combined with the idea of the meaning of life is merely the reproduction or the self-sustainability. The application of philosophical and ethical concepts is now significantly easier.

**What should be maximised?**

Reproduction, the transfer of information from one cell to another.
