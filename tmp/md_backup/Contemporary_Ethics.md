## Terms



## 25.January.18

- What is good?
  - On what scope do we define good?
    - where "good" must be a propType of an entity
- Instrumental Virtue
  - *Good means* VS. *Good ends*
- Trade-off between *Reliable*/*reliability* and *application*/*applicability*
  - The more reliable a hypothesis the less reliable it becomes -> adjusting scope of definitions
- A hypothesis must be *falsifiable* to be proven correct!
- **Ödipus Complex ** - a man´s struggle
  - Not falsifiable?!
- **Sigmund Freud** in consideration with the Ödipus Complex, makes it falsifying unimportant
  - Freud: The result of an answer can´t be falsified, as it can´t be determined for correctness.

## Thinking philosophically

- #### The Idea of an argument

  > A reason or set of reasons given in support of an idea, action or theory.

## Knowledge

- **Bishop Berkeley** and **epistemological skepticism**

  - Bored man -> experiments in self-made Lab -> Investigated Crude Oil (tar water) (used for dandruff shampoo)

    - First person to have shown interest in tar-water/crude-oil

    > *Dubito Ergo cogito.*
    > *Cogito Ergo sum*
    > -**Descartes**

    - Conflict of causation: Where everything that doubts has to be thinking and therefore is.

  - Thought experiment of God´s agenda:

    - *If any detail possible would be instantaneously availiable,*
      *the creation/alteration of any detail would/could cause a canvas re-paint;*
      *hence making the creation/alteration unnecessary in the first place.*

  - ​Hard VS. Soft Scepticism —**The tainted sources of knowledge**, *heredity, experience, culture*. Knowledge comes mostly from one of the three sources.


Philosopher´s conflict with ***consistency, precision, rationality, cuation and provisionality*** is an underlying concept. For example, a philosophical concept could be too broad, threatening precision of such concept and consistency over areas of knowledge. There is a **trade-off between applicability & reliability**.

> Abstract VS. Concrete —Human´s ability to imagine;

**Hard Scepticism** — question nature itself, how do we know that we know, etc…

* Bishop Berkeley´s refutation of Descartes

**Soft scepticism** — it is possible to know imperfectly. The truth is out there somewhere, but its yet to be found.

If knowledge can be acquired by **heredity, culture and experience**, the result of knowledge is the relationship between two variables. Two variables can be transferred easily, but is transferred knowledge true knowledge? —someone telling you fire = hot, you might still touch fire to make sure its hot. Hence, transferred knowledge is dependent whether or not one believes in the transfer of knowledge through e.g. culture. Genes, Evolution are the ultimate transfer of knowledge!

> A new born baby knows how to breath, move — where did that knowledge come from?

Is some data immutable? — like the underlying concepts that provide life, including the beat of a heart or breathing. If some data is immutable, meaning it havinig a solely reactive state instead of any active, the data itself cannot be mutable, but the parameters of what this immutable data defines! e.g. oxygen provision, blood flow etc.

## 30.January.18

###Innate knowledge and evolutioniary psychology

**Unconscious and unmodifiable, difficult to communicate, developed in and for different circumstances, Very, very slow to change**

e.g. definition of personal space being hereditary —everywhere seen, a universal human constant — feature of human life present in any culture

(five aspects of evolutionary hereditary) (hereditary fear of strangers — a stranger could be a threat — imagine the subway, over hundred people in confined space, crowded — a great framework for a caveman, stupid for commuters). (**Robert Ardrey and Territoriality** [territorial imperative and ethology]) (Xenophobia)

## 1.February.18

#### Story time — The swans and their territory

Interestingly, male swans do not have a problem with sharing a pond with some ducks, fish, pigeons etc., but as soon as another male swan enters the territory, the fight for the nesting site is on and the swan will protect the territory with his life. —Personal space exists throughout "life", but differs significantly from species to species, culture to culture etc. —*Territorial awareness seems to be hereditary!*

Interestingly, bird territorial awareness and through that flowing behaviourists are solely tied to the male gender, where as in the human species, the phenomenon of personal space is thoroughly present.

Ants enslave ants, humans do the same, no other species does. Does this fact state that human slavery might have natural roots?

**Robert Ardrey´s** second order of magnitude discusses marriage and dating customs throughout the human species. E.G: No woman would seek for a man driving his father's car, living with his parents etc… —A woman wanting to get to know a man would not seek that man's mother to get an insight into that man's life, preferences, wishes etc. —Though, many people do so! -> *Robert Ardrey is wrong about how the human species chooses a male.* On the same note, the human species has a varying pattern/method for choosing mates/marrying, though when comparing other species, the pattern/method is consistent.

> Personal space != bird territorial awareness —Ardrey got that correct.

*Robert Ardray, when talking about war and conflict, makes the misassumption, that it is territorial.* War is rather on a much larger scale of magnitude, in terms of parties participating, when comparing similar scenarios from how other animal species behave. A war between many animals normally just includes a relatively small count of participants (e.g. school of dolphins), where as in a war between humans, the magnitude is country-wide, on a national scale.

At the end of territorial imperative, Robert Ardray says:

> Why people say they are engaging, but the reason why, are genetically determined and unconscious.

* We seem to be born knowing things. On the other hand, we lack the tools to realise what is. Soft scepticism argues, that something exists out there somewhere, but the ability to reach anything is hindered. —The question arising is, how do we know something from the beginning of very life, but cannot expand our knowledge significantly.

### The Idea of "The Other"

> En.wikipedia.org. (2018). *Other (philosophy)*. [online] Available at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_(philosophy) [Accessed 1 Feb. 2018].

Someone distinctively and significantly altered in any aspects shall be regarded as an *Other*.

#### Story time — The romans invading England

Romans and christians/jews: romans feeding christians to lions, seem to argue that them getting eaten, is their own fault. (Roman gods may be inhibiting water, hence they made the bath [bath spa uni England] aqua sulus.) Romans commanded to have the god of water being called their way. -> if you have the same god, just named differently, why didn't your god protect you? (After romans invading England) ->why didn't god protect you? —"ahh thats god´s decision to make" -> the lions. The romans did not use the idea of "The Other" in their ruling ! **The romans hence were inclusive**.  *"If your god has a different name etc, but is basically the same as ours, your definition can deepen our understanding of our perspective of the god of water."*

### Experience

> How do you know, that what you learned through experience, will be true as it has been in the past.

Experience is finite and fragmentary. 

## 6.February.18

**Heinrich Hertz**, the discoverer of radio waves, to whom we nowadays thank the word named "hertz" in the area of science of frequencies. Important to notice and remember here, is that Heinrich Hertz did not *Invent* radio waves, but rather *discovered* them. E.G: Imagine a human born with antennae, he would be able to perceive more than a "normal" human. Heinrich Hertz discovered radio waves, that are normally undetectable for a human, hence by discovering it, humanity made assumptions based on science on impacts of the new discovery. This can be applied to E.G: radioactive radiation, which, after discovered turned out to be harmful, hence by knowing about it, we can "dodge" it.

My own experience is not just shaped by who I am as a human being, but rather as well by who I am depending on the circumstances, situation I am in etc. The main argument here, is that experience can me *malfunctioning* and not being reliable 100% and that experience depends on a lot of variables. 

> All inductive reasoning, depending on experiences, expressing patterns and extrapolating patterns, all that kind of reasoning is circular reasoning (as defined by mathematicians). 
>
> How do we know that what was correct in the past may/is also true in the future.

Things change. People change their names or hair colour and we only realise as soon as we update our knowledge. The only reason why we think the future is going to be like the past, is because the past has been like the past. 

### The uncertainty principle and observational bait

The observation of a phenomenon changes the phenomenon. Finding out about something changes what your finding something out about. The complete objective knowledge is unattainable, because whatever you're trying to learn about you're changing as soon as you try to learn about it. E.G: People behave differently when they're watched than if they're alone.

### Retaining knowledge —memory and language

Knowledge has to be retained in order to identify changes between retained instances of knowledge. Memory enables learning from experience, as memory can detect changes. No matter how efficient the storage algorithm of our brains, the storage is finite and information needs filtering and disposal for prioritisation. 

#### The selectivity of memory

The head is small the brain is big

> Remembering information based on its importance or value can help facilitate a person's quality of life by having them selectively prioritize specific information at the cost of being less likely to remember other, less important, information. — https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4b98r6mw

#### The corruptibility of memory

Your parents tell you many stories from when you were a baby, hence you remember it the way your parents tell you it was, where it shouldn't.

#### Memory apparently depends on language

It seems to be, but how. What if people don't know a language?  A theory describes how memories might be translated into actual text in any language to store information in form of "strings".

### Linguistic determinism

#### Orwell´s Newspeak and hard linguistic determinism

#### Russian blues and soft determinism

### Saussure and the idea of idiolect 

#### The arbitrary sign

Saussure made clear how linguistic signals are not having any objective content, but being completely arbitrary. What do words really mean? 

> An "H" is an "N" in Russian, but an "H" in English.

The sign is arbitrary, does not have any natural content, and words mean what cultural systems decide them to mean. Context specifies what content is being talked about. L´academie Français is Frances highest academic award to receive, they pursue to keep the French language up to date etc. E.G: they forbid the term "le blue jeans" instead of "pantalon denim". The British have an equivalent phenomenon. The Oxford English dictionary publishes a list of new words every year. Those words are not banned or anything, but rather recommend usage. **Correctness should be based on usage rather than institution.**

Where does "Innit" come from? E.G:"He's going innit?" This particle changes an unquestionable statement into a question. It exists because people translated a particle from Indian directly to English. "He is going to the shop isn't he?" The "isn't he" was never seen before. *Who decides the new language is right/wrong and how?* How can "innit" be grammatically incorrect? Should we vote? — Around two billion people (Indian, Pakistani, etc.) all use "innit" in their language naturally, but most speak English as a second language -> By far more Indians etc. are speaking English, if we vote about "innit", what about the majority of English speakers, Indians etc. ? 

How do you learn your first language? —you hear, understand and repeat whatever is said. Eventually, reading increases the process, by adding "seeing" into "hearing, understanding and repeating". What do you hear? —your own experience of language, which is different than everyone's else's experience of language. A first-born child experiences learning their first language is different than the learning experience of the first language for a second-born child in the same family. Hence, the experiences differ.

#### The idiolect

Your language. Private, special and unique to one. If language and how we experience language is unique to one. The tool we use for communication, exchange of information, storage of information, is arbitrary, unique for everyone and differ strongly in definitions and experiences of perceiving language.

### At least seven types of ambiguity

## 8.February.18

> Learning something new is difficult! —Alan Herz

### Confirmation Bias

> The confirmation bias, also called **confirmatory bias** or myside **bias**, is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. —En.wikipedia.org. (2018). *Confirmation bias*. [online] Available at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias [Accessed 8 Feb. 2018]. 

> Confirmation bias is a phenomenon wherein decision makers have been shown to actively seek out and assign more weight to evidence that confirms their hypothesis, and ignore or underweigh evidence that could disconfirm their hypothesis. As such, it can be thought of as a form of selection bias in collecting evidence. — ScienceDaily. (2018). *Confirmation bias*. [online] Available at: https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/confirmation_bias.htm [Accessed 8 Feb. 2018].

> The way social media are constructed and the algorithms run, they tend to feed you stuff you want to hear, meaning they feed you stuff, reinforcing what you already think. That's why you should read a newspaper you don't like, because your pre-conception will be challenged. —Alan Herz

### Observation Bias

> **Observer bias** (also called experimenter **bias** or research **bias**) is the tendency to see what we expect to see, or what we want to see. When a researcher studies a certain group, they usually come to an experiment with prior knowledge and subjective feelings about the group being studied. —Statistics How To. (2016). *Observer Bias / Research or Experimenter Bias: Definition, Examples, How to Avoid*. [online] Available at: http://www.statisticshowto.com/observer-bias/ [Accessed 8 Feb. 2018].

The observation bias talks about how people behave differently when they know they're being watched, compared to when they know they are unwatched. The simplest example, could be a speeding-camera. As soon as you know you're being watched through the camera, you'll slow down. Hence, the act of observation changes and interferes with the event itself. Originating from particle physics and Heisenberg´s uncertainty principle, the observation bias is scalable.

### Culture, or learning from others

#### Sources of cultural knowledge

A source for cultural knowledge can be your family, parents, siblings and even the extended family. Another source could be your local community, such as peers, neighbours or local institutions. The third source of cultural knowledge, includes organised religion, formal education or media.

#### Types of cultural knowledge

Types of cultural knowledge include language, the belief system used, the moral code applied, the customs and manners applying and the aesthetic responses. 

#### Critiques of cultural knowledge

JK Galbraith´s "conventional wisdom"	or	Michel Foucault´s "pouvoir"

**Conventional wisdom**, still believing something even after realisation of fault is possible. Professors stick to their views, even after public humiliation? 2008 financial crisis and balancing the budget Hence, **JK Galbraith´s** method includes A. Catastrophe and B. Learning from the catastrophes.

**Pouvoir** by Foucault is that everything you learned from other people, is shaped by the fact, that other people want to change how and what you think, in order to maintain control over one. Everyone talks bullshit to one, to make one more controllable. The only insanity that concerns us, is insanity that is difficult to control. Hence, a harmless lunatic shall pursue his business, as he does not interfere with the rest of society etc. where as a harmful lunatic would be lobotomised/thrown into prison. Categories of criminality are created by people who want to control you. E.G: walking past empty buildings and homeless people in front of the uni. Interestingly, the homeless person, making himself a home in the empty building makes him a criminal. That's because our legal system makes ones intrusion into another's property instead of making it necessary to maximise everyone's hedonism. Another example would be a man in the pharmacy not being able to afford the medicine that safes his son. —> People with power will perform power onto everyone else in order to control circumstances.

—>If your own hedonism is minimised by surroundings, other people etc. Then if you could maximise your own hedonism would make everybody unable to stop you maximising your own hedonism. E.G: Toilet training, makes children feel oppose to their bodies and alienates nature. Naturally, people are not used/intended to use a toilet, but we condition less powerful people (children) to do so.

Remember Bishop Berkeley? — Is the claim that he invent dandruff shampoo true? **History is significantly subjective**, may or may not be true, but in fact, is unfalsifiable and unverifiable. There does not seem to be a way to retrieve objective information from the past.

herbert marcuse — extreme marxist — research — he was working at the university of California, even though not liking the government. **repressive tolerance** societies like the U.S. are good allowing at the widest spectrum of opinions but loosing attention to the majority. "repressive" display of one´s view of the world opposed to displaying ones own. E.G: learning about marxism doesn't make a marxist necessarily, but rather I learn marxism for an exam, rather for my own personal gain. Interest is there, objective is inherited by repressive regime of society.

> Why would you not listen to and believe what your parents say, if cultural knowledge inheritance exists, it would make sense to believe elders.

> Societies like the U.S. have citizens having the feeling of normality regarding necessities, creating big possible problems for society as a whole. If you want to minimise the results of an effect, spend a lot of government money, the government doesn't have. Tax receipts will be down, bc economic activity is down, to bring it back up again, the government needs to accelerate local economy, forcing them into spending money they don't have as the sole solution. — (Keynes view of things)

## 13.February.18

> One law for the lion and the lamb is tyranny

If we consider the events of the holocaust and "auschwitz", the people being responsible directly for the killing of many people, were simply following orders. The question is, wether the pursue of holocaust-related subjects, should or could be punished for their actions. Considering that most people do follow orders significantly more likely if the superior wears a uniform and betrays a dominant figure, hence nearly affecting all subordinate nazi soldiers. They did however seem to have chosen that to do what they did. **Ted honderich** says there is no such thing as **free-will**. Who you are depends on genetics and culture and experience. Hence, you can only make decisions based upon your environment, culture etc.

### Complex learning 

We don learn by instinct or culture or experience, but we learn by instinct and culture and experience. Most knowledge is acquired by multiple input paths rather than singular. E.G: French kids learn French, not Japanese, e.g. because their parents speak French, not Japanese. The importance of language in any kind of complex learning should not be neglected. 

E.G: if theres no word for "freedom", theres no way of trying to enforce it. —1984 George Orwell. (You may be able to express the concept, but it will be significant harder.)

The words used in learning are going to be dependent on the language and its features as well as ambiguity within connotation and even denotation. E.G: The idea of society being equal, is attractive, but what type. Equality of outcome means hat everyone gets e.g. the same house and same car. Equality of chances and equality of starts. Consider: Max may need more assistance than Moritz. What would be equality in this situation, equality of outcome, starts or chance?

**Meaning**, has two aspects — Denotation and Connotation.

### Gate-Theory

You're programmed to walk, talk, do a lot of things, but the program will not execute, until certain pre-requisite circumstances are reached/achieved. E.G: Children can't walk and won't attempt to walk, until their physical body is strong enough to support the weight. Also, children that see many people walk around them, will start walking earlier, as more stimuli are being triggered earlier. Obviously, the pre-requisites need to be given.

E.G: a child being raised by humans, but then put into isolation, will not be able to re-implement itself into society. The development is determined by social factors and independent variables like physical pre-requisites. 

E.G: learning how to walk is a lot easier when you're so young, because the circumstances point toward the "learn how to walk" program. If knowing how to walk gets forgotten by e.g. a brain/head injury, the process of learning how to walk again, will be very hard, if not even impossible. 

E.G: homo-sexuality, the natural tendency to procreate will be hindered, when having a homo-sexual partner, hence also the natural tendency to not embrace homosexuality easily, is that their population will die completely after the generation ends. Hence, survival is not sustainable.

**Kind uncle-theory**, says that, If a person is e.g. homosexual, their genes are not being passed on to the next generation. Supporting your cousins children because you're homosexual, their support will be natural to you, as your cousins genes are close to being the same as your owns. Therefore, society's parameters to procreation affects you. E.G: a society without children but plenty resources etc will tend to make a person heterosexual. A person in a society with a lot of children, but not many resources etc, will tend to be homosexual (playing a supportive role) as it fits the society´s needs and balance of distribution.

## 15.February.18

### Equality

**Inequality if treated equally, can be good.** E.G: doctors that are paid significantly more -> ensure that the supply for doctors is enough for the demand. (Some people may not be able to afford a doctor)

> En.wikipedia.org. (2018). *The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas*. [online] Available at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ones_Who_Walk_Away_from_Omelas [Accessed 15 Feb. 2018]. —reference

We get away from not thinking about that our happiness is based upon ones misery. The people of **"Omela"** are said to better people, because they are aware of the fact. As soon as you take away that "one" from "Omela", their life and perception would become like ours.

## 20.February.18

Review of "**Omela**"

The right thing to do is to follow rules: They shall not torture children

Or they shall torture children for the greater good

**Consequentialist vs deontological ethics**

e.g. Immanuel Kant was a true deontologist. 

There is a deep and fundamental difference between lying and misleading. He thinks itstmuch better never having said "Im keeping Kosher", where not answering a question never asked is okay.

If a kretan says all kretans always lie, is he lying? 

Consider Creed, where it is sometimes good to lie. Is a lying Creed´citizien doing the right thing? No — Lying has an absolute value of being bad. They might do it and think its good by times, but it is still bad.

Cultural relativism — a practice may be right in a culture but wrong in another. Also the practice may be bad but so deeply integrated to turn off.  E.G: Widows burning themselves with the husbands cementation.

Principle of reciprocity in the categorical imperative. — Doing something I´d like me to do in their skin VS. Doing something based on what i`d like them do to me.

E.G: All cultures have pornography, its a cultural constant. Hence, is it good? Does it depend on the majority of people in a population?

### Categorical Imperative

Decision must be made within a categorical framework of action. There should be a framework generalising entities and basing decision not upon them. E.G: favour own child for admission.

## 22.February.18

An action that might be bad in a certain outcome may be good in a certain different outcome. 

###  Utilitarism and Jeremy Bentham

Utility is defined as the outcome which gives the greatest good to the most people. It is an essential concept for consequentialists. The core of the concept is happiness with the absence of pain, which should be maximised. It treats everyone's happiness the same, enabling a generalised definition. Bentham invents animal rights. 

> The animal can be made happy and can be given pain, hence we need to consider its happiness into our decision making process. —J Bentham NOT AN EXACT QUOTE

**Who´s happiness counts?** — if you can feel happiness, your happiness counts.

Happiness and pain need to be balanced.

All consequentialism depends on the fact that the future is uncertain.

## 27.February.18

1. Quesitons about 
2.  question about consequentialism utilitarism

Utilitarianism is consequentialist. At its core the decision making process of what is right to do, depends on the outcome. Utilitarianism is not equal to hedonism as utilitarian with the desired outcome of ones happiness. utilitarianism defines the good of one as less equal if it differs from the good of the society, the greater good. utilitarianism also says that happiness is not really mathematically definable, hence maximising it would be hard. If the outcome *obviously* maximises happiness, that's good. **LD-50 Test for additives**. 

Counterintuitive conclusion — if I'm thinking like a utilitarian, I don't want to do something that looses more than it gains. **Dr. Peter Singer** on **modern utilitarianism**. Utility can be defined rather loosely or rather specifically. *Animal liberation*, PETA and Body shop. 

### Peter Singer´s analogical, deductive, utilitarian argument for animal welfare

> People have interests because they can suffer. Animals are like people in that they can suffer. So animals must have interests as well. Democrats and utilitarians are obliged too respect all interests equally. We are democrats and utilitarians. Therefore, we are obliged to respect all interests equally. Animals have interests. We are obliged to respect all interest equally. So we are obliged to respect animal´s interests as much as people´s. *Put another way:* Speciesism is like sexism: it says some interests are more important like others. Sexism is wrong because it says that. Therefore speciesism is wrong. 

> julian baggini:  pig that wants to be eaten — reference

Its the suffering that counts, not the reason why suffering is inferred (like in omelas for the greater good)

### How good is Singer´s argument?

Do pople have Interests only because they can suffer? Do animals suffer the same way people do? People do have a greater magnitude of perception of suffering than animals or plants. Counterargument: The mourning process of elephants is very deep and emotional even for human standards. Are people really democrats and utilitarians? Are people merely democrats and utilitarians? E.G: Factory farming, animal suffering to create cheap meat. — The suffering of that chicken laying eggs is worth less than mine, thats how factory farming is argued. That of course may not be true.
