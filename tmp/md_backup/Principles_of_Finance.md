### Why financial systems?

* Helps the flow of money
* Payment
* Helps to connect
* Deficit unit
* Surplus unit
* Budgeting
* Valuation
* Investing
* Valuing businesses


* High liquidity investments correlated to time required

### Slide 25:

Shows what both parties seek! (three boxes represent possible problems/opportunities) E.G. many investors (private equity) have many small amounts and can deliver big amounts to businesses/borrowers

* (Household) investors want to invest small amounts -> companies can offer shares to enable small amount investments

**Brokers:** intermediaries (i.e. finding and providing a mortgage)

**Risk transformation:** grouping small amounts of money into big chunks and investing it -> bigger profit, less risk

**Maturity transformation:** requirement of money -> liquidity of banks -> not everybody can withdraw everything! -> people can´t withdraw endless amounts without re-stocking.

**Volume transformation: **regulating amounts of money to be spend at a given point in time. ->risk regulation!

### Slide27:

Information received from financial intermediaries highly limited -> lack of perfect information is driver of loss.

* Transaction costs: costs implied when making any transaction
* Problems decrease over time as economies of scale will act
* DN Capital -> financial system, bc it is abroker, asset transformer and market at once

## 30.January.18

***TEST on thusday 1.January.18***

Connecting the ultimate lenders with the ultimate borrowers is one of the key objectives of finance

### Financial Markets

* Primary Market — where securities (bonds, stocks) are issued
* Secondary Market — where securities (bonds, stocks) are traded
* Ability to liquidate a holding
* Reducing search, agreement and monitoring cost

Companies issue securities in exchange for money (liquidity) — that´s happening in the primary market. In the primary market, companies can issue securities to raise money for e.g. an Investment. **Liquidity** is key in finance. Securities are issued and the ultimate lenders exchange their savings (cash) for securities in the primary market. The problem faced, is what if the lenders want their money back for e.g. liquidity? —that´s where the secondary market comes in, allowing securities to be traded. A lender could go to a *secondary market* (like london exchange) in order to **liquidate their holding**!

### Debt and equity capital

Borrowing happens either by taking out loans or by issuing bonds. Interest is being treated as a tax-deductible expense.

**Debt** in this

**Equity** is defined in finance as ones degree of ownership! Hence, directly correlated to **shares**, hence equity is a part owned of a company. When holding a share, returns come along in the form of dividends and capital gains. To investors, shares are offered as a higher return, hence making them more attractive to invest money/savings in, than debt. Debt does not pay back any interest, where shares do! On the other hand, shares are more risky than just lending the money to a company, but an interest/return can be expected on shares. Risk is correlated to return expected!— should it?

Bonds are often traded in an active secondary market.

Capital Gain, is a scenario, in which the capital assets of a company appreciate/rise, and hence the part of ownership of one is being worth more than it was before the capital gain happened. The gain is only realised as the asset is sold.

> When a company does not pay dividends, investors expect capital gain to be the form of return.

### Exchange-trading and OTC markets

Exchange trading takes place on the myriad regulated share markets and other security exchanges. Hence, these places are identified as exchanges such as "NYSE" or "London stock exchange". These exchanges publish the prices of any security. *They are funded by a mixture of comission on trades, admission fees and annual charges for listings.* These annual fees are stakes of the companies that are listing their securities on the exchanges.

**Over-the-counter** (**OTC**) market, "*off-exchange market*", trade in securities between two parties on a private basis. The OTC market can put two parties like a household person and a broker in contact. The contact or the two parties can be in any relation (like friends). OTC Markets are **less transparent**! Published prices can though be seen on the internet for example. A part of OTC market securities are **pink sheets**, in general rather cheap securities, as they differ in annual fees and admission fees. Hence, OTC markets are more risky and the transparency of the prices traded is very low. Sidenote: most asset managers work with the OTC market.

**Market capitalisation** is the number of shares * the current price of the security. Market capitalisation can in turn be utilised to calculate a company´s value! (Total value/number of shares = price of shares) E.G: 18.5 million shares of "Facebook" are being traded every day (Avg. Volume). Still though, the Avg. Volume traded daily is significantly smaller than the overall size of shares available. Hence, buying 1% of Facebook is not possible, since Avg. Volume is much smaller!

### Bond Markets

Companies often need to borrow money. A bond can help realising that objective. Bonds are sold to investors and issued by governments or companies (in the UK calles gilts, in the US called treasury). They can be traded after issuance and must promise to be paid back. Bonds are tied to a time limit set before issuance. After the time limit expired, the capital sum must be paid with interest. Bonds can be governmental or corporate.

> Greece Benchmark Bond 10yr (DS) holds a red-yield and hence holds a lot of interest rate (%) per annum. —slide 3

Bond markets are relatively a lot more stable and less risky than share markets like FTSE100 or S&P 500! (Compare slie 4&6)

### Equity Markets

Owners of the company can vote directors on or off the boards to try to appoint a team. Limited liability for companies must be required. Limited liability ensures that lenders do not have to pay more than they have orignially lended the company, in case the company´s debt is larger than assets to be liquidate / cover their debts. On the other hand, **unlimited liability** also exists.

### Money Markets

*The market where such entities like banks, large corporations, governments issue and buy short-term borrowing/debt.* The **wholesale** market is an example of how a short-term debt could be arranged. Short-term is defined as being timely-less than one year. In the money markets, banks are particularly active and the biggest player besides large corporations, that can also lend money or the largest borrowers, governments.

### Foreign exchange Markets

(Include ECON stuff)

The FOREX market is all about the exchange of currencies. A day-to-day example could simply be "Travel".

### Three Twins Ice Cream

**Best sources of funding?**

- Loans from Bank unlikely, as stated in the case study.
- 2 million USD required
- 7-8$ per pint -> 5$ per pint
- Increase of production from 50000 to 2 million pints
  1. VC´s
  2. Angel investors/investment banks
  3. Long-term instalment payments e.g. Banks/financial institutions
  4. Leasing of equipment / mortgages
  5. SBIC´s/NMVC -> sale of stock?
  6. Friends/family -> not 2 million USD

VC´s Are super-category of angel investors (experts in specific area. Besides providing money, they provide expertise/knowledge/experience).

*Sessions 3,4&5 PPT*

### Banking

**Core Banking VS. Corporate Banking**

**Universal banking -> commercial banking -> retail banking( -> Core banking) && wholesale banking (-> Corporate banking)**

Most Banks do operate as a mixture of retail and wholesale banking. Serving households should be different than serving corporates, thats why two "lanes" are available as a path of banking to pursue.

**Cash management** refers to the allocation of accumulation and usage of cash deposited. Obviously holding cash does not generate any return, hence cash management is referring to what that cash should be used for, in order to generate a return. This perspective can be optional, meaning we can use the term from a banks perspective or a household. (Instead of depositing money, investing it)

**Syndicated Leading** is referring to a process in which multiple entities e.g. corporate banks accumulate a certain value and lend is as a bigger chunk instead of its constituent components respectively. (Like crowdfunding for big borrowings

*Other services* (Slide 5) can be referring to core banking or corporate banking. Both banking natures implement similar processes for mentioned services. One element its e.g. **factoring**, which describes selling receivables for a lower factor (discount) to other parties. (When in financial troubles, e.g. low liquidity) Hence, for these reasons, factoring is seen as a *last resort* solution.

> **Factoring** is a financial transaction and a type of debtor finance in which a business sells its **accounts receivable** (i.e., invoices) to a third party (called a factor) at a discount. A business will sometimes factor its **receivable** assets to meet its present and immediate cash needs. — En.wikipedia.org. (2018). *Factoring (finance)*. [online] Available at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factoring_(finance) [Accessed 1 Feb. 2018].

**Hire purchase**

> a system by which one pays for a thing in regular instalments while having the use of it.

### Investment Banking

*(Slide 6)*

Investment Banking are of *corporate and government assistance* and performs using *a form of market activity*. E.G. raising one million by issuing shares and selling those is hard as a sole party. Investment banks buy whatever remains from a share issuance and can sell the surplus on the secondary markets naturally. Market operations are a vital part of investment banks, trading their own money for bonds, stocks, derivatives, futures etc.

**Hedgefunds**

Prime brokerage for hedge funds is another market activity investment banks utilise. Hedge funds aim to be diversified in terms of how much money is allocated at one point, but rather specific, e.g. industry-specific.

### Core Banking

### Deposits

**Current accounts** (or sight deposits) are the biggest proportion of assets a core bank handles, normally ranging between ten and forty percent of overall assets. A core bank also offers **Time deposits** (or savings account), which mainly differs from a current account in not enabling the user to withdraw money before a *time period* expires. Withdrawing is harder with a savings account, but they offer interest paid as a return on your deposits, where *current accounts* do not. **Money market borrowing** is another proportion of assets. This term is referring to inter-banking or **repurchase agreements (repos)** and describes how banks interact with each other. The least proportionate asset category is **bank capital**. Bank capital is talking about the net-worth or a banks value to investors. (Expand definition of bank capital)

### Lending

Lending money from banks is possible by e.g. getting a credit. A **credit** can be obtained from a **credit card**, which enables you differently to lend money with a certain interest to pay back, depending on your **credit score**. The better the credit score you have at a bank, the more likely that you will be allowed to get a certain amount as a credit with a certain interest rate. Naturally, a bank lends money to those most capable of re-paying the money borrowed. **Lending** techniques include the screening and monitoring of borrowers to reduce risk. **Banks** would diversify across a range of borrowers as well to reduce risk. Loans to Individuals and corporations typically account for 50 - 70% of a commercial banks assets. 10 - 35% might be lent out to other banks and Institutions in the financial markets on a short-term basis. Less than 20% of assets are e.g. long-term government bonds, shares etc. The smallest, less than 10%, is accounted for as buildings, equipment, software and other assets. Other than that, banks still have their liquid reserves.

## 6.February.18

### Household lending

Consumer loans (personal loans) are unsecured.

**Secure VS Unsecure**

**Unsecured** lending would be: **credit card (2-3% per month), overdraft (2-3% per month)**

**Secured** lending would be: **mortgage (2-3% or less per annum), auto loans (6-8% per annum)**

If the loan is not paid back, the bank will seize collateral and court will declare one bankrupt, excluding one from any ability to borrow money for five years.

**Payday lenders** give loans to small entities for short periods of time, attached to a high interest rate (0.8% per day). The high percentage in interest rate, makes this choice of borrowing money less logical, in fact, the credit card has a smaller interest than a payday lender.

Credit scores are utilised as well for household lending, to calculate a credit score, there are parameters shown in the reference provided.

> https://mycourses.hult.edu/courses/2243436/files/122162587?module_item_id=36103901 —reference

### Corporate lending (lending to businesses)

**Banks** make it attractive for companies to borrow by having low costs for legal and administrative aspects, their operation speed, flexibility and availability to offer loans to not only big firms, but also small firms.

Business lending includes an **arrangement fee**, which is paid besides everything else, as an on-top commission, taken by the bank. The **interest rate** can be either **fixed or floating**. The **Base rate or LIBOR (London interbank offer rate)** is a term of agreement based upon a base rate called LIBOR. The arrangement will normally include a LIBOR plus a certain percentage on-top. The  **BBA (British banker association)**  would publish the **LIBOR** every day and is seen as a benchmark to aim for. Most trustworthy and respective customers will receive the base rate only.

**Types of Lending:**

* Personal overdraft
* Term Loans
* Loan covenants
* Flexible loan
* Personal loan
* Graduate loan
* mortgage
* Start-up loan
* Business loans
* Credit card loans
* Business overdraft

Debt consolidation accumulates constituent debts there are into one. One debt to rule them all!

## 8.February.18

### Comparing different types of lending

The **difference between overdraft and normal loan**, is where in overdraft the bank can withdraw the debt money at any point in time, where as for a normal loan, a fix period is set prior to issuance in which the money may be used by the borrower and may not be withdrawn from the lender (bank). Another difference is that the overdraft is easier to access, given it is build in to nearly every debit/credit card and the issuance of a loan requires intensive paperwork.

**Working capital loan** describes *current assets* and current *liabilities*. This type of loan may be used to expand inventory or use it for monetary cases, such as paying off another loan etc.E.G: allowing customers to pay within one month, a working capital loan may be set up for use within the payment period for the customer (Maintaining liquidity).

**Cash Conversion Cycle** — The time needed from payment for raw materials, to the moment that cash is received from customers. If there is a gap, that needs to be filled.

**Asset Financing** — Discusses **fixed assets** and the financing of them via a loan. E.G: Vehicle finance, Equipment finance. This type of finance is mainly for fixed assets.

### Loan repayment arrangements

>  10,000 $ borrowed, repayable over four years with interest at 10 % p.a. —slide 14, session 3

![FIN_200_01](https://github.com/tyronyiu/tachyon/blob/master/src/img/assets/FIN_200_01.png?raw=true)

The *first* Scheme is **Mortgage-style repayment arrangement** requires four instalments, each being the same amount.  The *second* is **Interest only paid each year** pays same, but low amounts of payment instalments in the first three year, and asks for a big payment in the fourth year. The *third* is **Bullet loan with interest and capital repaid at the end** includes paying no instalment the first three years and a complete and big payment in the fourth year. This option could be considered most risky, as it involves paying one big instalment, which should be harder to accumulate and less likely to be repaid. The *fourth* Scheme is **Balloon-style repayment schedule** is start with no payment in the beginning and ascends the payment per annum as time increases.

### Payment mechanism

The payment methods included in the payment mechanism, are **Cheque		Giro		standing order and direct debits		plastic cards	landlines and mobile phones		the internet**

Giro comes from the Giro-account.

Direct debit is set by company, where they will manage the payments to process for you. The standing order method is the client-side of the coin, meaning it enables people to control what to pay, when and to whom.

#### Committed facilities Vs. Uncommitted facilities

Commitment = promise; In committed facilities, banks give one a promise that an amount of money may be given. In uncommitted facilities, banks may give you money, but do not have to promise to do so. An example is given below.

#### Corporate Banking

They are **uncommitted** facilities. They do not enter an agreement that makes it obliges to provide funds at the borrowers request. The facility can be cancelled and so the borrower may have to repay at short notice.

#### Committed facilities

Whenever an amount is required, the banks is required to give it to one, but at a cost called interest + commission fee etc. They use **resolving credit (resolving credit facility, RCF)**, which allows the borrowing of money at an instance and repeatedly. E.G: a company needing a gap-loan consistently/multiple times in a row, could simply go to one of many *resolving credit facilities* to easily borrow money.

### Project finance

Normally it has been talked about the usage of loans for the company itself, now in **project finance**, the loan will instead be used for a special project. Equity Capital for a separate legal entity is called SPV (**special purpose vehicle**). The company now is a sole legal entity, isolating it for risks etc. and using borrowed money more narrow. **SPV´s** are formed to build and operate a project. E.G: SpaceX, where a SPV could be the installation of a Tesla roadster as pay-load (nature of project isolated by main mission, which was the maiden launch of Falcon Heavy). **Project finance loan** is then provided as bank loans or through bond issues directly to the separate entity.

### Syndicate lending

Includes a few accumulated banks, collectively accumulating amounts to lend.

### How a bank operates

> **Total assets = Total liabilities + Capital**

Shareholders do not have the right to withdraw their money from the company at any time, it is **permanent capital**. (Imagine people pulling money out of Apple, making them unable to operate.

#### Key bank management skills

Includes **liquidity management		Asset management skills		Liability management	Capital adequacy management**	 

#### Liquidity risk

Banks collect money from many people, and invests that into low-liquidity investments.

**Reserves** include cash the bank is required to hold in the accounts with the central bank, plus cash that is has on the actual premises (*vault cash*)

> Example: If 8% reserve is required of 1000, then 80 is the requirement and 920$ is **excess reserve**.

Reserves are also "assets" and the current account is the liability that acts to balance. — No Equity, No Capital.

Besides the **required reserve**, 4% of the value of its current account liabilities should be held as **excess reserves**, enabling that the lender (customer/person) may withdraw money at any time.

#### Balance sheet for BarcSan as a whole:

![FIN_200_05](https://github.com/tyronyiu/tachyon/blob/master/src/img/assets/FIN_200_05.png?raw=true)

#### Where is it going to get the shortfall from?

**Borrowing from the Central Bank**

![FIN_200_06](https://github.com/tyronyiu/tachyon/blob/master/src/img/assets/FIN_200_06.png?raw=true)

**Securities could be sold for liquidity**

Easy to sell and to liquidate, hence may be the best option...

![FIN_200_07](https://github.com/tyronyiu/tachyon/blob/master/src/img/assets/FIN_200_07.png?raw=true)

**Borrowing from other banks and other organisations**

![FIN_200_08](https://github.com/tyronyiu/tachyon/blob/master/src/img/assets/FIN_200_08.png?raw=true)

**Reducing its loans to re-gain liquidity**

A bank asking their borrower to give back money surprisingly, will not have good impressions in the market, especially its customers.

![FIN_200_09](https://github.com/tyronyiu/tachyon/blob/master/src/img/assets/FIN_200_09.png?raw=true)

#### Asset and liability management

Banks should aim for **highest return on investment**, while **minimising the investment risk**. They do so, by *diversifying* their portfolio, spreading risk. Different loans should be offered and provided, to lower risk. **Liability management** is focused on the judgements made about the composition of liabilities as well as the adjusting of interest rates offered to lender to the bank to obtain the target mix of borrowing, diverse.

#### Capital adequacy management

> **Fear of insolvency** — an inability to repay obligations over the longer course of events, rather than liquidity, which is insufficient liquid assets to repay obligations falling due.

If there is a sudden outflow of cash, Bancan´s capital to assets ratio is 900 million/ 10,900 million = 8.3 %. Mercurial ratio of capital to assets is 3.7%(400 million / 10,900 million).

![FIN_200_10](https://github.com/tyronyiu/tachyon/blob/master/src/img/assets/FIN_200_10.png?raw=true)

**Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)** — only for stock/shareholders

**Return on Equity (ROE)** = Net Profit / Equity(Capital) — for everyone investing in the company.

Hence, **ROE(Mercurial) > ROE(BarcSan)**

**Both Banks have invested 500 million in bonds which are backed by US sub-prime mortgages. These become worthless.**

![FIN_200_11](https://github.com/tyronyiu/tachyon/blob/master/src/img/assets/FIN_200_11.png?raw=true)

**Capital-to-assets ratio has fallen to a less conservative 3.8% (400 million/10,400 million)**

![FIN_200_12](https://github.com/tyronyiu/tachyon/blob/master/src/img/assets/FIN_200_12.png?raw=true)

Diversification is now achieved by classifying mortgages for their likelihood of being repaid and then selling/backing the mortgage as bonds. E.G: 2008 Real Estate crash, is exactly what happened when the value of the securities backed by mortgages falls significantly, without the value of the mortgage falling proportionally.

The fact that capital is negative, indicating that liabilities are greater than assets, meaning that money cannot be paid to e.g. investors (shareholders). That is why there is a **required capital**, in order to use it as a "safety-cushion", hence **capital is rather important for banks and their ability to operate.**

#### Key measures of bank performance

To measure performance of a bank, these key measures may be used. **Net interest margin (NIM)** — NIM = (Interest income - interest expense) / Assets

**Loan to deposit ratio**

**Cost-income ratio (C/I)**

## 13.February.18

**commercial paper** is arranged by banks and can sell the paper to others. A commercial paper is comparable to a promise to pay X amount defined by the paper.

### Financial review analysis tools / formulae

**ROE = Net profit / Equity**

**ROA = Net profit / total assets**

**NIM = Interest income - interest expense / total assets**

**C/I = non-interest expense / net-interest income + non interest income**

*Ineterest income - interest expense = net interest income*

Non-interest expense = total income - profit before taxes*

*Non-interest income + net-interest income = total income*

#### Santander analysis

**ROE = 7486 / 102699 = 0.073 * 100 = 7.3%**

**ROA = 7486 / 1339125 = 0.0056 * 100 = 0.56%**

**NIM = 55156 - 24067 / 1339125 = 0.023 * 100 = 2.3%**

**C/I = 33464 / 44232 = 0.76 *100 = 7.6%**

#### Barclays analysis

**ROE = 2237 / 71365 = 0.031 * 100 = 3.1%**

**ROA = 2237 / 1213126 = 0.0018 * 100 = 0.18%**

**NIM = 10537 / 1213126 = 0.0087 * 100 = 0.87%**

**C/I = 18221 / 21451 = 0.85 * 100 = 8.5%**

Santander has higher capital and higher assets than Barclays, making it more secure. Santander´s margin is 0.56% on top, which is nearly four times as high as Barclay´s. Net-Interest margin for Barclays is much smaller than for Santander. The C/I is lower and hence better at Santander´s.

### Core functions for investment banks

1. Provide advice and help to government and companies to raise capital/money.
2. Market operations, meaning trading, investing on their own
3. Help financial structuring e.g. mergers
4. Asset management services

A boutique investment bank indicates an attribute as "small or specialised". Boutique investment banks hence specialise e.g. into a specific area or type of investment banks responsibilities. The opposite of boutique investment banks would be bulge bracket investment banks.

**Bulge bracket investment banks** are Goldman&Sachs, Chase and Morgan Stanley

## 15.February.18

**Session 6ppt**

### Investment Banks (extended)

Core Operation of an **Investment bank** is in fact raising funds primarily, and investing money, which would be deductible from the name, secondarily.![FIN_200_13](../../img/assets/FIN_200_13.png)

> The illustration above shows the responsibilities that an investment bank may have and the operations it may perform.

#### 3 themes by Goldman & Sachs

**1 basis point = 0.01%**

> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7QrnPrXjo4 —**reference**

1. Revenue and Earnings rose, where market making fell (where market making might include trading of shares, bonds, commodities etc.).
   1. Asset management increased to 1.5 trillions dollars
   2. Investing and lending activities increased as well
   3. ROE grew by 140 bps (**BASIS POINT, = 1.4%**) total of 10.8% now.
      1. E.G: Barclay´s is 3.2% and Santander´s ROE is 7.3%
2. Set to **Growth mode**.
   1. Including 5 billion dollars of investment into technology, relationships with clients, in-house communication, AI etc.
3. 2018 Predictions:
   1. **tax charge** was mentioned multiple times, e.g. a big tax charge in 2017. **The tax charge** discusses the earnings made of U.S. companies made outside of the U.S., which needs new taxation.
   2. The interest rate increasing, makes the circumstances for investment banks more comfortable.
   3. Macro-economic growth will ease the situation further.

### Corporate and government assistance: Advice on financing and raising finance

**Underwriting new security issues** is one of the main aspects. An **Initial public offering (IPO)** or **Seasoned equity offerings (SEO)**, which is going to be used after a company already had an IPO. Also included are the selling of bonds, **commercial papers** and **medium-term notes**.

### Mergers and Acquisitions

Requires expertise and a recognised name will be respected by investors in decisions about mergers and acquisitions. For pure advice fees for smaller company deals are approximately 3 to 4 percent of the total sale value; for larger deals (considering billions) range between 0.125 and 0.5 percent.

> https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp —**reference and definitions for mergers and acquisitions**

### Corporate restructuring

**Divestiture** means to disvest.

> https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/divestiture.asp —reference

**Balance sheet restructuring** - Change the source of financing in a company, either balance equity, debt, credit etc.

> http://www.cs.odu.edu/~dlibug/ups/rdf/remo/rba/rbardp/rdp9308.pdf —Australia Bank

**Valuation and procedural matters for bolt-on acquisitions** Similar idea, if ht company wants to acquire something, investment banks help them to do so. E.G: a company wants to sell a department and an investment bank may help them to set a price for any entity.

**A strategic review** development of strategies, e.g. moving into new countries or target audiences.

**Relationship managers ** a company might have difficulties to keep communications with all its investors, investment banks take over this responsibility.

### Market entities

Market entities are **Brokers, Market makers, proprietary trading and corporate brokers.** Remember that brokers are only middle men. **Market makers** are entities that is ready to buy/sell the same securities from the investors. E.G. a currency exchange, as it will buy and sell, both services to one, providing both directions. Market makers make bid and asks prices and hence define the spread.

> Staff, I. (2003). *Proprietary Trading*. [online] Investopedia. Available at: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proprietarytrading.asp [Accessed 15 Feb. 2018]. — **Proprietary trading definition**

#### Market Makers

They use a **Quote-driven system**, which automatically matches buyers and sellers. Most exchanges today use a quote-driven system.

![FIN_200_14](../../img/assets/FIN_200_14.png)

> **Quote-driven system demand and supply illustration**

The difference between ask and bid prices is called the "Trader´s spread" or "bid-ask spread" or simply spread.

### Fixed income, currencies and commodities trading (FICC)

> http://www.dtcc.com/about/businesses-and-subsidiaries/ficc — reference for **FICC**

Most banks also trade equities, derivates, and other securities.

**FICC is a combination of services/products exchangeable**, it includes most securities etc.

> Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (**FICC**) provides a variety of trading, research, sales and financing services across the globe with an underlying specialization in interest rate, commodity or foreign exchange related institutional trading, marketing, lending, clearing or platform provision. —**reference for FICC**

### Securitisation and other structures products

They **originate and distribute debt**.

When the bank gives a mortgage to a client, the mortgage identifies it as an asset (because interest and principle gets collected.) **capital** restricts investment banks from letting their assets exceed their capital. Capital is limited, which restricts infinite mortgages, as assets would exceed capital.

The accumulated mortgages will become an **SPV**, being identified as projects to finance. The reason of accumulating them in an SPV reduces risk and increases diversification. Now, the SPV can issue bonds in different categories. Class C high risk, high return, Class A low risk. These bonds are now bought by investors (may often even be the investment bank itself), paying the SPV and the SPV giving the money to the super-positioned investment bank, allowing them to issue new mortgages. If the mortgage won't be repaid, the SPV is reliable, not the investment bank.

### The Mutuals

Are **member-owned** and **Mutually owned**. They do not have two pay returns to shareholders.

The membership base, which operates for the members primarily. An example of a mutual would be a **trade-union** or a **building society**. They accumulate a lot of money from the members and only pays to the members equally.

In Europe over 4500 Mutuals exist and include over 50 million members.

**Factoring** & Factors?!

### Insurances

4.1 Trillion dollars of insurance premiums paid, which is nearly 600 dollars for every human.

Rich businessmen would agree tot pay for parts of any losses in return for a sum of money, writing their name under the wording of the contact.

#### Insurance underwriting

Assessing risk involved and seeing the terms and costs off the premium to be paid. This leaves **Asymmetric information**, **adverse selection** and **moral hazard** attached.

#### The insurance process

Direct from an insurer at tone of their offices, over the phone, or via he internet, which is becoming increasingly popular. Through an agent who usually works for one insurer. Though an insurance broker or independent intermediary. Through a bank, building society, solicitor, travel agent, mail-order agent or accountant, who will receive commission on sales.

#### Life/long-term insurance

**Insurance policies** to cover people in different ways for loss of life. Its a way of **saving** and is **term assurance**. **Whole-of-life** and **endowed**. **Annuities** and **pension schemes**.

E.G: 70 yr old retired person has 2million pounds in savings and spends 100,000 pounds a year. An **annuity** is meant by the action, where the retired person gives the whole 2 million to a life insurance company and receives e.g. 80,000 pounds a year.

#### General insurance

Insures **property** including, **open policies, named peril policies**. And **Casualty** and **Liability**.

General purpose insurance companies need more liquidity because of more unexpected things that could happen e.g. natural disasters.

Life Insurance companies are usually up to four times bigger than general purpose ones.

## 22.February.18

Premium in insurance is the amount you pay to get insurance.

#### Reinsurance

Reinsurance is insurance companies lessen their exposure to risk by transferring the risk to a reinsurer. There is proportional reinsurance and non-proportional reinsurance.

### Pensions

> Why does the U.S. have the biggest pension market?

Normally pension systems are divided into two systems.

#### Unfunded schemes

They are **public unfunded pension schemes** and render a Pay-as-you-go scheme. They describe the sole transfer of a fund.

> In an unfunded defined benefit pension, no assets are set aside and the benefits are paid for by the employer or other pension sponsor as and when they are paid. — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension

#### Funded schemes

The insured, and their employers, make regular payments to a pension fund. Where essentially, an investment must be made, which is going to be re-paid afterwards. e.g. A person pays his whole life into a pension fund and gets monthly fixed income after he retires, which is being pulled from the pension fund he invested in earlier.

#### Defined Benefit

Tells you how much you get when you retired based upon a formula. **Defined benefit** is the more secure and less risky option two choose.

A **defined benefit** (DB) pension pays out a fixed amount based upon the number of years worked and the level of final salary or the average level of salary. For example, a member of one-eightieth scheme. The number of years you have been contributing is multiplied by 1/80 and then multiplied by your final years salary (or some average over a number of years). e.g. worked and contributed for 40 years and final salary is 30,000 Euros, the entitlement for defined benefit is 40/80*30,000 = 15,00 per annum.

**(years of work / scheme part) * avg. salary**

#### Defined Contribution

**Defined Contribution** (DC) is where the amount of your part from the employers pension payment is being invested in a funded scheme pension fund and be paid out at whatever the market performs at when your pension is being paid out from the fund.

**Defined contribution** is more risky but may be more rewarding as any investment may be. Also when job changes are frequent, the defined benefit option may not be the best option, as contribution time may be short. E.G: **BHS**, a company that operated and used a DC funded pension scheme for its employees went bankrupt and hence all the pension funds were lost for the employees.

The actual pension paid out is linked to the return on the assets of the pension fund and the rate at which the final pension fund is annuitised. At retirement age, an annuity is generally purchased.

#### Personal and Private pensions

The recipient pay a regular amount or a lump sum to the pension provider who will invest it on their behalf. It is run by financial organisations such as insurance companies, building societies or banks. The contributions qualify for full tax relief and the fund can grow without tax being levied on interest income or on capital gains. At retirement age 25 % of the fund may be taken in cash, tax free.

22 -> 70 years = 48 years.			70 -> 110 = 40 years.

The problem is that we nearly spend as much time being retired as being in the labour force. Hence, it makes sense to save right from the beginning.

###  Pension fund trustees, constants and managers

- 'Float' — the remaining amount after transactions (deposits and withdraws) which is being invested again.
- Consultants — tell you whats best to invest in
- Trustees — people that watch how managers are managing pension funds, ensuring stable and secure operation, preventing stealing etc, allowing the best interest for the client.
- Managers — manage the money

Most Pension fund assets allocations in 2009 went to Equities. E.g. UK Equities were over fifty four percent, where Bonds (fixed interest) only thirty six percent.

The BT pension scheme investment assets in comparison from 2001, 2005 and 2009 most investment were UK equities, which actually decreased over time.

Life insurance VS. Pensions — Life insurances are better because they are longer term, because people life longer. On the other hand, the death of a person may occur suddenly. The only constant is **We know when a person will retire, but we don't know when he will die.** That's why pension funds are mostly actually longer.

#### Collective Investment (Funds)

Funds, unit trusts, investment trusts are all collective investment schemes. The unique aspect is that money is prior accumulated and afterwards invested. The World´s collective investment outsize every countries GDP.

#### Collective investment offers some significant advantages to investors

They offer a more diverse portfolio to be created. Even very small investors can take part in the stock markets and other financial markets. Normally they are under professional management, where investments can be made into exotic and far-flung markets that are normally inaccessible to households.

**far-flung markets / exotic markets** — E.G. emerging markets, market where a lot of money can be made but barriers to entry exist.

The *Disadvantages* that may occur is high fund-management, leaving little choice where to money goes in the end for the end-investor(households). They can underperform and investors lose any right the the company direct share investment.

**REITs** — Real Estate Investment trust

### Open-ended investment vehicles

Its a type of collective fund that does not have restrictions on the amount of shares or *units* the fund will issue. The value of each share is dictated by the net-assets-value **NAV** divided by the number of existing shares. **NAV** is defined as the total value of assets at current market value less any liabilities. Open ended funds must buy back shares when investors wish to sell their shares.

There are four different types of open-ended investment vehicles:

#### Unit Trust

They are not a legal entity, you need to get a license, but are not a legal entity (not registered as a company, doesn't have the same liability). That matters, because investors are not liable and investors also do not have to pay *corporate tax*. (No taxes except income tax.) they are able to issue more shares whenever they want. They will then set a bid-ask spread, selling them higher than they are being bought for, making money which is covering operation costs.

The value of the share depends on the value of the fund.

Theres an *initial charge* (sales or front end), then *annual charges* and an *exit charge*.

#### Open-ended investment companies (OEICs)

It is a legal entity ("company" in the name). They are normally very big (E.G: Invesco Perpetual, BlackRock, Jupiter unit trust managers ltd). Invest Perpettual is one open-ended investment company, butt has thousands of funds. A *ETF* on the other hand would only have one singular fund.

#### Exchange traded funds (ETF)

They are companies issuing shares to buy a range of securities. The pricing is left up to the marketplace. *You can trade these shares on a stock exchange.* Hence it is easier to buy and sell them and the money doesn't actually need to be pulled out of the fund when a share is being transferred/sold. The ETF´s normally reflect what the money is invested (*Synthetic replication of an index*) in, E.G: S&P500 is an index that shows the value of the 500 biggest companies in the U.S. and FSE 100 for the UK. Investors buy and sell their shares at prices subject to change through the day and trade at or near to the underlying net asset value. Charges range normally between 0.2 % and 0.75 %.

#### Mutual Fund

Any fund that collects investments and invests it again is called a mutual fund. Its a generic term for collective or pooled investments. In the U.S. and Canada the term has the specific meaning in terms of their organisation and legal structure **...**

### Close-ended Investment vehicles

After the initial money is collected, the money collection stops and the money is invested and laid aside, until its paid out. The advantage is that theres no fear the investors may want to have their money back, it´s tide in the fund.

#### Investment trusts (Investment companies)

Set up as companies and floated on the London stock exchange. They are constitutional, handle big amounts of investments with over 400 investment trusts being over 80 billion in total assets. In-house team of investment managers manage the money to their best performance which pays returns to investors and covers operation costs. They can also hire external managers to grow their returns and leverage. Again a problem can be seen in having to pay out money from the trust directly if investors want their money back.

#### Sovereign wealth funds (SWF´s)

Collective funds set up and managed by the government. They operate to achieve certain economic or socio-environmental objectives. They are normally huge of over 3,000 billion of investments around the world in total. E.G: Russia has a big sovereign wealth fund for infrastructure development.

#### Custodians

Custodians are guardians or safe-keepers of securities. Custodian banks are investment companies, operating especially pension funds and mutual funds in the US, in return for a fee. They safeguard, monitor and distribute dividend payments, capital gains and general information relating two the diverse range of assets. They offer protection for investors agains any illegal or fraudulent activities. HM Revenue and customs keeps a list of approved custodians.

### Money Markets (ST borrowing)(Part two of the course)

Money markets -> bond markets -> stock markets -> derivative markets (after reading week) (not covered markets e.g. forex and commodities)  

#### Interbanking

is about interbank borrowing and lending of Money under the consideration of LIBOR

#### Eurocurrency

has been used even before the Euro was established. It was used whenever a currency has been traded that is not the domestic one. E.G: trading US dollars in the UK. Its about borrowing and lending, which is not the domestic currency. E.G: lending US dollars to one in the UK would be described as UK-Dollar Eurocurrency.

**Eurocurrency is best described as:** Currency which is deposited or lent out outside the jurisdiction of the country where the currency was issued with your vote, option 1 of 4.
#### Treasury bills

Are government bonds from the USA (gilts in the UK). The difference between a government bond and a treasury bill is, that a treasury bill is usually considered for less than twelve months and does not entail a coupon. Where as a government bond is usually for the long-term. (Could be considered as opposites), if a bond would be issued for a time span between the usual average time span of a treasury bills or bonds, it would be considered a **Note**. ST -> Bill, Mid-term -> Note, long-term -> bonds.

**UK Treasury bills are best described as:** Issued by the Debt Management Office with a par value of £100 and a maturity period of 12 months or less. The price is determined by the market, not by governments. 

#### Commercial papers

is a promise to pay, issued by companies (normally only well-known and big companies only issue commercial papers, turnover has to be over 150 million and they have to be a public, listed company.) Companies issue the commercial paper, they then can be traded on a secondary market.

#### Repurchase agreements

the biggest and probably most important one which creates the huge amounts of borrowing and lending between banks, because of the security it provided. Its could be said that around thirty percent of a banks assets are bound with an repurchase agreements. E.G: an asset being worth 10 million $. When doing a REPO agreement, the assets are being sold for 9 million and simultaneously make another contract to buy back the same assets for 10 million in 1 year. Selling now for 9 million and buying back a year after for 10 million. The asset is a collateral, a security ensuring the repurchase will happen.

#### Local authority issues

Local governments are local authorities. They can also borrow and lend money within a money market.

#### Certificates of deposits (CD)

 are traceable like commercial paper on a secondary market.

#### Bills of exchange and banker´s acceptances

is more important to international trade. When a company buys supplies from another, the seller will ask for a credit, which is being repaid by the buyer after specific time span. E.G: I don't know you, heres the promise, the bank can then put their emblem (Zeichen/Stempel) on the promise, guaranteeing the exchange.

These are the major money markets tools utilised. A money market is where Short term borrowing or short term investments are being handled. One wants to borrow in the Short term, is to ensure liquidity and keep cash. The problem with cash is, the devaluation due to inflation. The money market is being utilised for counteracting a possible devaluation and the uncertainty of not knowing exactly what to do with that money. A money market is where short term borrowing and lending takes place. Normally, interest is not paid on top of the borrowing, but rather from discounted pricing, as seen in Repurchase agreements.

### Interest often comes from discount pricing

Selling an instrument which carries the promise to pay, can be considered as an item where interest comes from discount pricing. The Yield is what we pay or receive on the money we've  got. 100,000 compared to 10 million of face value, 9.9 million is the price, hence 100,000 is the yield. You pay 100,000 on 9.9 million. An item with discount pricing as source for interest is sold for less than the face value, where the difference is the yield. Secondary market exchange of such items are negotiable. This market is very liquid, having many sellers and buyer, where the price normally doesn't go that much down (percentage), due to the big amounts of money.
