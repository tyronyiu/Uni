Following, I will lay open the theory of *Sudden Stratospheric warming* and the creation of thus caused *Polar vortex*. The following was written in an attempt to reason the causation of the abnormally cold weather experienced early 2018.

## The Sky is tearing apart
Typhoon Tip demolished in 12/10/1979 the Philippines and was the most powerful, largest and intense tropical storm ever recorded, reaching wind speeds of 305kph and a radius of over 1000km. This is nothing compared to what is happening above us right now and its bringing super cold temperatures to Northern Europe. To understand what is exactly going on, one has to consider the different atmospheric layers. Typhoon tip, like all storms we experience, was trapped in the lowest layer of the atmosphere, which we call the *Troposhpere*. We can divide the atmosphere into layers by analysing the relationship between temperature and the height from the ground. Closer to the ground, as going higher up above the ground, the temperature decreases. This segment is called the *Troposphere*. At around 10 km this behaviour changes, temperature stays relatively static, until kept going up further, where the *Stratosphere* layer begins, the temperature here actually starts to increase again.

The air is much thinner than in the *troposphere*, but the *stratosphere* much bigger, stretching from 10km all the way up to around 50km. And right now, the *Stratosphere* is the home to the most powerful storm in the world, *the stratospheric Polar Vortex*.

**The Stratospheric Polar Vortex** exists, because every year, the earths winter pole does not receive any of the sun's light, making it extremely cold, while the equator is still relatively warm (Comparing Northern Europe, e.g. northern UK, the winter side, to Southern Europe e.g. the south of Spain, its natural, that it is still relatively warm closer to the equator). This is the default  behaviour of *non-tidally locked planetoids*, unlike other planets, where one side is always towards the orbiting star. The Overlay between the winter pole and the equator, (as the two have an approximate thirty degree angle in which they intersect) is now a mix of very warm and very cold air, which drives a huge circulation in the stratosphere. Air starts to rotate around the pole, forming a circulation that is about 6000km in diameter, in relation, that size is on continental scale. And it moves quick as well, averaging over 200kph and maxing out at around double, 400kph, making it way faster than any typhoon or hurricane. Due to the rather spheric shape of earth, there is a secondary formed storm in the souther hemisphere, which is a lot stronger, averaging at over 300 kph in wind speeds.

You'd expect a storm like the one in the northern hemisphere to be stable, especially after relativising to typhoon tip, but every now and again, a few times every decade, it falls apart, like it is right now.

Starting around the ninth of February, the normally pretty stable and coherent Polar vortex starts deform and tear itself apart, splitting in two. Now instead of having one giant version of mega storm above your head, now there are two of them. This event is known as a **Sudden Stratospheric warming** and the reason of this event happening right, now will influence the weather across the northern hemisphere for the next month and a half to two months.

## Analysing the abnormality of 2018's sudden stratospheric warming

This shows a *normal* view of the Northern Hemisphere  (22nd March 2017) and how air flows, indicating also warmer and colder areas, as air flow is derived from air pressure, which indicates temperature. On the left, windspeed can be read at the current position. 49 kph here does not seem violent at all. It is clearly visible that the scale of the *Polar Vortex* was much smaller in 2017 than in 2018.

This is what is happening above us right now (actual depiction from 16th February 2018), illustrating again, the flow of air. The windspeed sky-rocketed from 49 kph to an astounding 214 kph! Clearly visible in this animation, is the **Polar Vortex**, seen in reddish colour. And how it split apart into two Vortex, where one is in fact much intenser than the other. Let us now have a look at the the same conditions, but observe temperature.

![Screen Shot 2018-03-05 at 17.59.21](https://github.com/tyronyiu/tachyon/blob/master/src/img/assets/16Jan18.png?raw=true)

The above image shows the temperature at 10 hPa, as seen in the left data area, this is a snapshot from a more normal condition (16 Jan. 2018). The illustration clearly shows a temperature of -75.4 degree celsius, which is normal for the time of the year at that height from the ground. Lets now compare to whats happening in the event of a *sudden stratospheric warming*:

![Screen Shot 2018-03-05 at 19.26.05](https://github.com/tyronyiu/tachyon/blob/master/src/img/assets/16Feb18_2.png?raw=true)

Now this image illustrates the 16th February 2018, note the giants light-blue area indicating warm air, which is staggering 3.2 degree celsius warm! That is a 86.6 degree celsius increase in temperature! That is a 2256.25% increase in temperature! You can also see how the wind speed decreased quite significantly. In this image, the event of a *sudden stratospheric warming* are clearly visible!

### Analysis of the implied effects
First of all, because it is called *warming*, you'd expect this event to have a positive and warm impact on the weather at the ground, but actually it is the exact opposite. The sheer violence of the circulation splitting apart, causes the air over the poles to be compressed down and that compression results in *significant* heating. To just put the heating into scale, imagine your room heating up from 20 degrees celsius up to 70 degrees celsius in a week. This is exactly what is happening right now, while the vortex splits apart. By having the vortex split apart, the air in he stratosphere doesn't warm up by 10 or 20 degrees celsius, it heats up by 50 to 80 degrees celsius! As the name suggest, this compression and warming of air within the stratosphere happens quickly, in a matter of days! It is like having the arctic transform into the Sahara. This very month, parts of the northern hemisphere have warmed by over 70 degrees celsius in less than a week.

Second of all, remember that all this is happening about 50 km up and the air is less than 1% as thick as it is at the surface, and yet these events like the *Sudden Stratospheric warming* are so violent, possibly the most violent events on this planet, that they still have a very real influence on the weather we experience at the ground.

For about two months, it can be observed that storms tracking heir way across the Atlantic are deflected further south and freezing cold air, normally held in position at the poles, by the strength of the *Polar Vortex* is able to penetrate further south and reach towards the equator. (As air currents get created to balance differences in areas with different air pressures.) This brings extremely cold, actually arctic weather.

> Pronounced weakenings of the NH
> wintertime stratospheric polar vortex tend to be followed by episodes of anomalously low surface air temperatures
> and increased frequency of occurrence of extreme cold events throughout densely populated regions such as
> eastern North America, northern Europe, and eastern Asia that persist for approx. 2 months.

Furthermore, we can expect this to happen and already experienced this happening. The recent snow storms did seem quite abnormal in the context. Why this specific event happens, is something of an unanswered questions. This is because the causation and relation between the different atmospheric layers and the interactions involved in trans-atmospheric air circulation, as seen in a *Stratospheric vortex*. In this specific area of research, the relationships and effects between entities are extremely complex, these are theorised, but unfortunately not yet completely solved. What researchers are though sure about, allowing me to base the explanation of bad weather on *Sudden Stratospheric warming* and the creation of a *Polar Vortex* or in this year's edition **Two** *polar vortex*, is the following:

First of all, people in the northern hemisphere will start feeling the effect of the sudden warming (end of February). That influence will now stick around for a couple of weeks (approximately until mid March). And it is going to get much cooler in the northern hemisphere, especially the upper and mid-altitudes, due to the southern flow of artic air, which takes place in these areas. Eventually, the vortex will gradually reform itself into, as initially, **one** polar vortex, normalising the northern hemisphere.

### TL;DR

So, if you are experiencing abnormal cold weather right now or have recently, you are now able to blame it on the biggest and most violent storm in the world the, **Polar Vortex** that formed due to 2018's abnormal **sudden stratospheric warming**, splitting and re-uniting the sky.
