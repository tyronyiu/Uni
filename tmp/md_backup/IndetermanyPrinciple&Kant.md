Just today, I was reading an article on *Immanuel Kant´s* arguments of how not interacting physically is always a right action to call, if following his argumentation. Not interacting, could mean watching but not acting, or it could mean a thousand other things. What was never clear to me, is the scope of his definition. What defines *interacting?* Because interacting is normally solely seen physically, where as observing is commonly seen as not-interacting. I have a problem with this limited thinking, which is why I will argue, that Immanuel Kant´s argumentation of observing being the same as not-interacting, is not the case.

In quantum physics, all approaches to finding a theory of everything stumble upon the same seemingly unsolvable problem, **the Heisenberg uncertainty principle**. The model in its simplest form makes it indeterminate to evaluate a fundamental particles´ position and momentum in the same instance. This is due to the fact that light, protons are being reflected off things, in order for the protons to eventually enter our retina. By *seeing*, having a proton be reflected of something, this *something* is obviously interacted with. The interaction is on the atomic level and hence, relatively seen negligible for people's perception and consideration, right? — Here is where I really have a problem with common interpretations and most argumentations, that these principles couldn't be considered at larger scale or be considered as relevant for larger magnitude considerations (E.G: not considering *observation*, but considering *haptic interaction*). To further explain my point, short arguments are being listed.

### Mathematical and physical principles at scale

Excluding the uncertainty principle into one´s considerations because of scale, is a ridiculous argumentation. Gravity, one of the seemingly strongest forces, considering black-holes or even earth´s gravitational potential, is in fact the weakest of all four possible forces in the universe. Considering the electromagnetic force, which is consistent in scale and comparing it to gravity, it seems like gravity scales less as one factor changes, ceteris paribus, compared to the electromagnetic force, which actually seems consistent.

Mathematical principles, such as the Fibonacci sequence or the golden ratio are principles that can be observed in the atomic structure, while being observable in the constellation of galaxies. The scale does not matter it seems. But physics and maths aren't the same, a mathematical principle can't be compared directly to a physical interaction such as *observing* or *physically/haptically interacting*, or can it? Maths describes the relationships between entities, physics describes the relationships between entities in the physical world. One could argue that mathematics should be treated as a separate dimension, due to its separateness from the physical fabric. Opposing that, The physical fabric has since *string theory* and the paradox of information (black holes destroy information, is that possible?) be considered as multilateral, including meta-physical interactions. This way quantum physics can be unified with special relativity by Einstein. The concept that even information is made up from *strings* that vibrate in more than ten dimensions simultaneously, destroys every argument of not considering *mathematics* and hence *non-direct physical interactions* as elementary different from *interaction with information*.

Furthermore and Henceforth, **Information is elementary the same as anything physical.** A thought is just the same as an apple, both things made from the same core. Maybe one could illustrate this point by stating that this month, constituent parts from the first stars in the universe (just after the big bang) have apparently been identified in a molecular structure. Solely the thought of how many interactions must have had happened since then, clarifies the point, of how small of an influence physical interactions can have on metal-physical entities. (A similar thinking approach is used in alternative healing like homeotherapy, [Homeotherapy uses dilution processes in ratios of 10^-26 for measuring densities of active ingredients (thats not a single molecule remaining, hence in the common view impossible to have any effect.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathic_dilutions) )

### The Double-slit phenomenon - the uncertainty principle in action

In quantum physics, scientist came upon a phenomenon also called *the observer effect*. The observer effect is basically the integration of the uncertainty principle´s theory. A common example to illustrate this phenomenon on every-day scale, is measuring the pressure in a car tire. To insert the measuring instrument, you first have to allow some air-flow. Therefore the pressure is lower now, than it was before you decided to measure it.

In quantum physics this principle is so extreme, that even passively, not intentioned observations and even observations made by excluding other options change the outcome. The question is **if observation really affects every outcome on a quantum level, does it on our every-day scale?** Yes it does, consider where you are right now. Take a look on the clock. How do you know what time it is? -By looking at the numbers. Could it be one hour later than it actually is? — how do you prove it wrong, falsify this theory without looking at the clock? Looking at the clock determines the time, before you look, it could be theoretically every hour of the day. Is it dark outside? - its probably after 2pm, can you be sure? - it may be a solar eclipse? This specific argumentation might seem abstract, but I hope the essence is clear. The time is e.g. 10pm, but by not looking at the clock, I bet you wouldn't be able to distinguish between whether it is 2155 or 2205. By looking at the clock you destroy all but one option. As information is the same as a physical entity, the effect would be the same as having contestant fight for the winning… Its a probability calculation.

### The indeterminacy principle in symbiosis with Kant?

**The observer effect is applicable at scale.**  And is hence not equivalent with not-interacting. If observing is having an effect on the outcome and hence is not equivalent to not-interacting and is considered as *interacting*, then one could not be an observer and comply to Kant´s argumentation.

> **You could hence only comply and be truly non-interactive, (just adding observing to consideration) one must not observe an event nor interact with it in any physical or metaphysical method. **

Metaphysical interactions, include thinking, as stated, information is the same as any physical entity. It makes sense that there is always a metaphysical interaction when physical interactions occur and vice versa, hence the two are correlated and have a causality relationship. So, can Kant and the indeterminacy principle be put into symbiosis in any way? —No, Kant´s argumentation changes significantly from not looking at something, to not thinking about something on top to all the other preliminaries, and can hence not be combined with the indeterminacy principle or modern physics. The limitations of the model arose just lately and most theories in this argumentation are still debated, but would change the implications of interactions within any dimension and realm.
