Following the what is happening back in Germany by online watching the news, lead to a situation where contemporary ethics may be applicable in the sense of isolating arguments raised and viewing them multilaterally and further develop meaning to what has been already said and done.

Adjoining with the German political parliament structurisation, the discussions turned to the rather right extremists' party named "*The alternative for Germany*". The other parties basically perceive them as being outsiders as their political views are being strongly nationalistic, which is considering Germany´s history regarding nationalism, not a sweet spot for a German politics debate. Naturally, a more central positioned politician soon enough made a comparison to the nazi-regime, ultimately leading to a debate on memorial culture.

Essentially all parties agree on the fact, that there should be a culture and education throughout the country regarding the time period, though what that contains is up to debate.

The *AFD* stated that the memorial culture today to be biased and affected by *debt silence* (not talking about something that you're ashamed of. — of course there´s a word for that in German) and the other parties would be choosing the easier way, which is not talking about certain topics. They also incline that the memorial should not be biased by *debt silence*, by not seeing the time period in question (the nazi-regime) as negative or to be ashamed of. I agree in a sense that there should be no shame. Those mistakes were done generations ago, not by current ones. Funnily, even for myself, as I am not even completely German this time period is an uncomfortable topic and I would agree that is because there is such a negative perception of it in Germany.

The more central positioned parties opposed that view by stating that memorial culture should be a symbol of responsibility. That means that memorial culture should be responsibly managed and henceforth educated and culture. They very strongly emphasise the fact, that some topics should be *untouched* to ensure a responsible image (which is a typical decision to make for centrally positioned parties… excluding things from the equation and make conflicting rules).

As a matter of fact, the illustration of the symbol affiliated with the nazi-regime is illegal in Germany. Often this has been criticised as an **intrusion into free speech**. This is also used as an argument by the *AFD* later in the debate.

This all, the education and culture of memorial culture should go in hand with the fight against racism, as that being a hot topic right now. In Germany, there are also limitations of free speech in terms of racism. That is important because of the many rules and etiquette that are broken by the *AFD* regarding racism actions such as not permitting certain "races" within their party.

All of this was important, because of the underlying problem that arises within the German community (Biggest German News Channel), which is the **instrumentalisation and abuse of history**. This statement was multiple times thrown from row to row inside the parliament. In my opinion, there should be limitations in terms of how and what is publicly displayed and embodied. That ensures that a family walking down the street won't see info about the holocaust and maybe even some pictures, because the country should not be ashamed of its past. All parties agree again, on the point that there should be no abuse of history and the instrumentalisation should be guided, ensuring responsibility. The fact is, that the question of when and how to utilise history for utilitarian objectives, won´t be adequately answered by politicians with opposing views. And on that note, the left extremists' party exits the debate with a very withdrawing and typically left-extremist statement: "*Learn to live with each other instead of against each other and let us remember that as democratically apprised political leaders.*"
