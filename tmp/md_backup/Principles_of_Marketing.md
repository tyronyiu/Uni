### An effective Marketing Mix

An effective marketing mix includes four aspects. The marketing mix should ***match customer needs (or wants)*** , should be ***well balanced***, should ***match corporate resources*** and should ***create a competitive advantage***.

When talking about price, all parties, B2B, B2C, actually everyone should care about the price of a good/service. Price is vital when looking at Break-even, shutdown and operating cost. **Price Wars** show how every party must consider price on their ow, but also how analysis should be utilised for comparison.

> Google analytics is free, compared to similar services, that went bankrupt or were acquired due to Google winning a price war.

Promotion — the fourth P of Marketing, gives an indicator about ROI or ROMI (return on marketing investment, where Marketing can be promotion). Additionally to the four P´s of marketing, three can be added, making it **The seven P´s of Marketing**

* Price
* Place
* Product/service
* Promotion
* People
* Process
* Physical evidence

**Competitive advantage** can occur as e.g. by lower production costs. In nature, a competitive advantage will ensure operations, hence rounding up a well-created marketing mix.

**Customer needs** (Economic, performance, availability, reliability, durability, productivity, psychological, self-image, quiet-life, pleasure, convenience, risk-reduction) have to be listed and identified in a general way.-> **Key Customer requirements** should be identified in a given audience. <—> **Competitive advantage** should now be applied to exploit opportunities.

### The relationship between market orientation and profitability

**Commodity businesses** are displayed as a U-shaped diagram, where Profitability is on the y-axis and Market orientation (Low, medium, high) is categorised. The **Non-commodity business** on the other hand, is linear, as market orientation progresses.

### The Marketing environment

The actors and forces to operate correctly acting upon a business. A business is not within a vaccuum, but in an environment with multiple entities. In this environment, parties could be of any nature. **PESTEL** can be utilised! (**include BUS100 material**)

* **The Marketing environment** —The actors/forces affecting a company´s capability to operate effectively in providing products/services to customers
* **Macroenvironment**
  * ​
* **Microenvironment**
  * Customers, Investors, Creditors and Journalists/Media -> e.g. of players affecting a company´s capability of operating.
  * Customers, Competition, Distributors, Suppliers etc.

### Discussion on Coca-cola, pop music and FIFA

**How is coca-cola using sponsorship?**

As a promotional tool for expanding reach of their brand´s influence, internationally

**Is it delivering value for them?**

"Wavin´Flag" was actually more associated with the FIFA as the official anthem of the World Cup. Though it should/could have been directly related to the Coca-cola company, where most people do not associate it this way.

**Do you believe Sports and Music are effective for sponsorships? For what brands?**

Obviously.

### Key performance indicators

**Key Performance indicators** (KPI´s) allow the observation and comparison of performance and can be used as a tool of analysis of a businesses absolute or relative performance.

### Benefits of the Marketing concept
- Customer Value
- Customer satisfaction
- Customer loyalty
- Long-term customer relationships

### Creating Customer Value
- Perceived benefits ->(positive) Customer Value <-(negative) Perceived sacrifice
- Positive: product benefits, service benefits, relational benefits, image benefits
- Negative: monetary costs, time costs, energy costs, psychological costs

Customer Value Creation can depend on the perception of positive and negative benefits implied by both parties, depending on the related parties in question. E.G: a Company might choose PWC as a consulting because their image within the industry is well known.

### Steve Jobs on Marketing
**what did Steve Jobs believe was the key to marketing success? Do you agree?**
The key to marketing success is talking about what the brand/company is actually having for objectives/intentions instead of talking about superiority or features of specific products. Agreement about the superiority of the marketing strategy utilised is natural, as success has been shown as a Proof of Concept.
**what does the Apple brand stand for?**
The Apple brand stands for giving customers the best experience in using it every day instead of giving one a product with great specs etc. E.G: They sell a feeling/lifestyle instead of a product itself.
**will it Continue to thrive without Steve Jobs?**
It already has succeeded to overcome any concerns relating Steve job‘s death and his successor Tim Cook. The Apple brand is to this day one of the finest and most successful, having record high sales and profits every quarter.

### Trans-media storytelling

Trans-media storytelling is a technique that allows a story to unfold across multiple multi media platforms and that solicits the participation of fans and end-users in the story's expansion across these media.

#### Is it an important part of marketing in 2018?

As social and multi media spread and expand within human societies, trans-media storytelling becomes more important, considering the rising amount of media platforms available.

#### Was the hunger games catching fire campaign good marketing?

Considering the 10 million facebook likes, 850,000 followers on twitter and its youtube video being among the most ever watched, "hunger games catching fire" being trending on google and twitter as key-words, the 158 million made at box-office weekend and 864 million total globally, which is incredible, considering that similar movies like the "maze runner" movie only made 32 million on the first weekend, and making it the tenth highest-grossing domestic movies ever, the movie "The Hunger Games: catching fire" is a complete hit in regards of marketing. The reach of target audience and interactiveness as well as influence ability is reflected in the ROI and the sale numbers.

#### How effective was the measurement?

Measures at this level of complexity, considering the number of media platforms utilised in trans-media marketing, the complexity of the network of nodes and edges became uncomprehensive. The effectiveness of measurement can only be used, when looking at causality-chains and what the result of trans-media marketing is, relative to the result measured without trans-media marketing. Important to notice, is that conventional/traditional marketing measures should or could may or may not be utilised upon trans-media marketing. The results of traditional marketing measures used upon trans-media marketing, may not be working, due to the difference in the natures of the two marketing tools/strategies.

#### Is this the future of movie marketing? All marketing?

Considering the growing number of media platforms and social media platforms and the rapidly growing content, the answer is nearly obviously that this will become a necessity in marketing for the future. If A brand doest apprise a singular or limited channel of information flow, their reach of audience will be limited. Trans-media´s success can be seen in news, movies, etc. and counting. To conclude, it will more likely become a tool for general marketing as it would only become or does become for movie marketing. Movie marketing definitely needs to sustain their trans-media marketing, not halt it.

#### Characteristics in relation

When looking at any entity, there are characteristics that describe the entity throughout. When considering marketing, the central method of action, is to display the characteristics of an entity, in this example a product, because it has those characteristics that may make it special. Henceforth, the characteristics of any entity may give powerful insight to the marketing possibilities at hand.

### What is marketing in the digital age?

A point to consider is the dilemma of "showrooming", in which the facilities and services are being used freely, but the product would be bought online, leaving no commission for the showroom owner. These situations arise more frequently as the Digital age progresses.

The buyer is not an automaton, he is a human being.

### B2B Marketing and Sales

Customer is a business decision maker. Spending their company's money and being part of a team making  the decision, who is motivated by the desire to do a good job and the fear of error and career ambitions and their job security. In B2B there are complex decision-maker units, opposed to B2C, where its mostly as simple as a customer a seller and a coke and money. Buyers need to be seen to be buying well and people buy from people they trust, like and from companies they trust and like.

If your products/services are *commodities*, you need to *differentiate* your offering in terms of *service, logistics, your people*. Nothing lasts forever, all things must pass, thats why you should look after your customers to keep them for longer. Furthermore, extract more value by *maximising* **customer lifetime value (CLV).**

#### The Changing B2B buyer

> The way businessmen buy is changing. Nine out of ten buyers say when they are ready too buy, they will fin you. 81% of them star the process with a web search. Many are fifty to sixty percent of the way into the buy cycle before they Weill even make contact with a vendor.  — DemandGen Report http://www.slideshare.nett/G3Com/content-preferences-serveyfinal. & http://earnestagency.wordpress.com

### Pricing

What is an airline seat worth? An airline is a profit maximiser, hence maximising prices, within the range of general market prices. The considerations for valuing an airline seat depend on the demand given, the competitions prices and should follow cost plus calculations. Is there uncultured value? Would customers pay more or would want to pay less for a similar product? **Differential pricing** is a method by which prices are being differentiated by the eigenvalue of the product/service, considering above mentioned. **Value pricing** ensure that the price is worth the service/product. **Price curtains** are a circumstance in which customers are aware of the price they paid only, not what another might have paid. 

For pricing, optimally use the value pricing method within the process of determining an adequate price. Also economic models can be applied, such as the basic demand setup or the kinked demand, when considering competition´s prices.
