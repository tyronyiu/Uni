*Market driven strategy*

All businesss strategy decisions should start with a clear understanding of markets, customers and copmetitors. 
The market and the customers that form the market should be the starting point in shaping business strategy.

*Push and pull strategy*

Manufacturer -> Retailer -> Customer

You can push the product from the manufacturer through to the customer. If the manufacturer addresses the customer directly. The customer will demand that product from the retailer. The customer is pulling the product into market, while the manufacturer is pushing the product to the customer.

*Characteristics of a market-driven strategy*

  * Becoming Market-Orientation
  * Determining Distinctive Capabilities
  * Customer Value/ Capability Match
  * Achieving Superior Performance
   
=== Opportunity analysis ===
*Look at value system to discover new business opportunities*

*Liberate trapped value*

Create more efficient markets (Ebay)
Enable ease of access
Create more efficient systems (FedEx)
Disrupt current pricing power (Priceline)
(By liberating more value more revenue streams can be used.)

*Introduce new-to-the-world value.*

Customise offerings
Extend reach and access 
Build community
Enable collaboration
Introduce new functionality/expertise

_Either liberate trapped value or introduce new-to-the-world value._

Customer, Technology, Company, Competition

Traditional Competition - Samsung, Apple, Nokia 

Untraditional Competition - if of 1000 bucks you spent 300 bucks more than expected, reduced the purchasing power.
rent 500 bucks, 300 bucks into new gf. 200 bucks remaining.
thus the non-traditional competitor pressures your purchasing power and maybe shifting the interest.

*Opportunity Evaluation*

The two phases:
  * Qualitative:
    * Matches the attractiveness of an opportunity with the potential for uncovering a market niche depends on:
      * Competitive activity
      * Buyer requirements
      * Market demand
      * Supplier sources
      * Environmental factors
      * Organisational capabilities
  * QUantitative:
    * Market sales potential estimates
    * Sales forecasts
    * Budgets

*Marketplace and Customer needs*

_Market offerings_ are some combinations of products, services, information or experiences offered to a makret to satisfy a need or want.

_Maket myopia_ is focusing only on existing wants and losing sight of underlying consumer needs.

_Backcasting_ - the opposite of a forecast. 

*Marketplace and Customer Needs*

| Needs                                      | Wants                                            | Demands                            |
| States of deprivation                      | Form that human needs take as they               | Human wants backed by buying power |
| Physical - food, clothings, warmth, safety | are shaped by culture and Individual personality |                                    |
| Social - belonging and affection           |                                                  |                                    |
| Individual - knowledge and self-expression |                                                  |                                    |


*Customer Value and satisfaction*

* Customer perceived value
  * The difference between total customer value and total customer cost
 
* Customer satisfaction
  * The extent to which a product's perceived performance matches a buyer's expectations. 
   
You could integrate *Customer surplus & shortage* into the concept of customer perceived value and customer satisfaction.  

*Understanding the marketplace and customer needs*

Customer value and satisfacrion expectations:
  * Marketers set the right level of expectations which are nor too high or to low
  * Customers feel Value and satisfaction 

*Cost of acquiring a customer* - Basically, the CAC can be calculated by simply dividing all the costs spent on acquiring more customers (marketing expenses) by the number of customers acquired in the period the money was spent.
For example, if a company spent 100 on marketing in a year and acquired 100 customers in the same year, their CAC is 1.00.

*lifetime value* - In marketing, customer lifetime value (CLV or often CLTV), lifetime customer value (LCV), or life-time value (LTV) is a prediction of the net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer.  
The lifetime value of e.g. whatsapp with half a billion customers is around 60 per customer.

Thus, a great LTV monetisation should be coupled with a low cost of acquiring a customer.

*Value proposition*

Focus comes from cleary understanding the value of your idea. 

A _one-to-two sentence statement_ describes that:
  * What your product/service is
  * Who your customers are
  * Why its valuable to these customers
   
"Winners is a department store that offers fashion conscious customers the latest brand names for up to 60% off."

The value proposition template above would benefit from an additional section on where the benefit and value lies. (Why the product has a value)

*Generic strategies & combined strategies*

[[Generic strategies & combined strategies]]

CAC and CLV can be integrated by considering that dropping the price due to comparative advantage, the cost of acquiring a customer decreases and the customer lifetime value increases due to happier customers as of the lower price.

Differentiation is a high risk strategy.
You cannot differentiate if you do not have market presence.

The above strategies provide the foundation upon which organisations can establish both, a comparative advantage, as well as defend against aggresive competition.
Competitive advantage that is easily recreated, offers limited benefits to the company.
