  Ethical Theories

## Four Kinds of Ethical Theories

We organize ethical theories into four broad categories:
- Consequence-based
- Duty-based
- Contract-based
- Character-based

## Duty-based Ethical Theories

Immanuel Kant argued that morality must ultimately be grounded in the concept of duty or obligations that humans have to one another.

For Kant,

Morality can never be grounded in the consequences of human actions.
Morality has nothing to do with the promotion of happiness or the achievement of desirable consequences.

Theories in which the notion of duty, or obligation, serve a foundation for morality are called deontological theories.
They derive their meaning from the Greek root deon, which means duty.
Kant defends his ethical theory on the grounds that:

Humans are rational, autonomous agents;
Human beings are ends-in-themselves, and not means to ends.

## Rule Deontology

For Kant, morality conforms to a standard or objective test, a principle that he calls the Categorical Imperative.

Kant's imperative has a number of variations, one of which directs us to:

Act always on that maxim or principle (or rule) which ensures that all individuals will be treated as ends-in-themselves and never merely as a means to an end.

## Categorical Imperative

Categorical imperative, would lead to a system based on two essential principles:

- Universality
- Impartiality

Every individual would be treated fairly since the same rules would apply universally to all persons.
Categorical imperative has been criticized because it cannot help us in cases where we have two or more conflicting duties

## Criticisms of Rule Deontology

Example: We have duties to both keep promises and to tell the truth, and sometimes we encounter situations in which we are required either to:

Tell the truth and break a promise or to keep a promise and tell a lie.

Kant does not provide us with a mechanism for resolving such conflicts.

## Act Deontology

David Ross argues that when two or more moral duties clash, we have to look at the individual situation (or “circumstance”) to determine which duty is overriding.

Like act utilitarians, Ross stresses the importance of analyzing individual actions and situations to determine the morally appropriate course of action to take.
Unlike utilitarians, Ross believes that we must not consider the consequences of actions when deliberating over which course of action morally trumps or outweighs another.

Ross believes that certain prima facie (or selfevident) duties which, "all things being equal," must be followed.

Prima facie duties such as honesty, benevolence, justice, etc.

Example: We have a prima facie duty not to lie and a prima facie duty to keep a promise.
If there are no conflicts in a given situation, then each prima facie duty is also an actual duty.

We can determine what our overriding duty is in a particular situation by using a two-step deliberative process:

Reflect on the competing prima facie duties, weigh the evidence at hand to determine which course of action would be required in a particular circumstance.

## A Dilemma Involving conflicting duties

You promise to meet a classmate one evening at 7:00 in the college library to study together for a midterm exam for a course you are taking.
 While driving in your car to the library, you receive a call on your mobile phone informing you that your grandmother has been taken to the hospital and that you should go immediately to the hospital.
You consider calling your classmate from your car, but you realize that you don’t have his phone number.
 You also realize that you don’t have 1me to try to reach your classmate by e-mailWhat should you do in this case?  

For a rule deontologist (Kant), the answer is unclear as to what you should do in this scenario, since you have two absolute duties.
For Ross, however, the following procedure for deliberation is used.

You would have to weigh between the two prima facie duties in question to determine which will be your actual duty in this particular circumstance.

In weighing between the two conflicting duties, your actual duty in this situation would be to visit your grandmother, which means, of course, that you would have to break your promise to your friend.

However, in a different kind of situation involving a conflict of the same two duties, your actual duty might be to keep the promise made to your friend and not visit your grandmother in the hospital.

## Scenario

In analyzing the following scenario, describe how an act utilitarian, a rule utilitarian, a rule deontologist, and an act deontologist would each reach a solution to this dilemma.

Which solution seems most plausible?

> You have just been appointed to the board of directors of XYZ.com.
  Unfortunately, the dot-com company has been experiencing some difficult financial times, resul1ng in revenue losses in three of the last four quarters.
  As you assume your new posi1on, you discover that two proposals are on the table.
  Each proposal has been put forth as a means for dealing with XYZ’s immediate financial problems.

  Proposal #1 recommends that all employees be retained, but that an immediate freeze on salary increases (raises) for all employees be imposed for the next six months. (Employees may even be asked to take a 5% cut in pay if things do not improve by the end of that period.)

  Proposal #2 recommends that wages not be frozen, but that 5% of the XYZ’s work force be laid off. (One piece of reasoning behind this proposal is that taking more dras1c measures will “protect” 95% of XYZ’s workers and will send a message to Wall Street and local investors that XYZ is serious about improving its financial posi1on and that it will soon be a stable company once again.)

  The board is evenly split, seven members favoring proposal# 1 and seven
  favoring proposal #2. Yours will be the 1e-breaking vote.

## Contract-based Ethical Theories

The social-contract model gives us a motivation for being moral.

For example, it is in our individual self-interest to develop a moral system with rules (Pojman 2006).

Motivation for establishing a moral system is absent in both the utilitarian or deontological theories.
Contract-based ethical theory seems to have one advantage over them.

### Criticisms of Social Contract Theory

Social-contract theory provides for only a minimalist morality.

It is minimalist in the sense that we are obligated to behave morally only where an explicit or formal contract exists (Pojman 2006).

Many situations involving morality where are no express contracts or explicit laws describing our obligations to each other.
Most of us also believe that in at least some of these cases, we are morally obligated to help others when it is in our power to do so.

### Philosophers differentiate between two kinds of legal rights:

- positive rights
- negative rights.

Having a negative right to something means simply that one has the right not to be interfered with in carrying out the privileges associated with that right.

For example, your right to vote and your right to own a computer are both negative rights.

Positive rights are very rare and are much more difficult to justify philosophically.
One's right to receive an education is a positive right.

Because all citizens are entitled to such an education, they must be provided with a free public education.
If education requires Internet access at home, should students also be provided with free Internet access?

## Character-based Ethical Theories

Virtue ethics(also sometimes called "character ethics")

Ignores the roles that consequences, duties, and social contracts play in moral systems in determining the appropriate standard for evaluating moral behavior.
focuses on criteria having to do with the character development of individuals and their acquisition of good character traits from the kinds of habits they develop.

Instead of asking, “What should I do in such and such a situation?", a virtue ethicist asks:

“What kind of person should I be?"

The emphasis is on being a moral person not simply understanding what moral rules are and how they apply in certain situations. 
Virtue ethics is "agent-oriented”

### Criticism of Character-based Ethical Theories

Character-based ethical systems tend to flourish in cultures where there is a greater emphasis placed on community life than on individuals.

In the West, since the Enlightenment, more emphasis has been placed on the importance of individual autonomy and individual rights.
In the Ancient Greek world of Aristotle's time, the notion of community was paramount.

## Summary - Four Types of Ethical Theory Type of Theory

- Advantages
- Disadvantages
- Consequence-based (Utilitarian)
- Stresses promotion of
- happiness and utility
- Ignores concerns of justice for the minority population

Duty-based (Deontology)
: Stresses the role of duty and respect for persons
  Underestimates the importance of happiness and social utility

Contract-based (Rights)
: Provides a motivation for morality
  Offers only a minimal morality

Character-based (Virtue)
: Stresses moral development and moral education
  Depends on homogeneous community standards for morality
