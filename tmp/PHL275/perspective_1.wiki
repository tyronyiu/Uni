*Perspective # 1: Cyberethics as a Branch of Professional Ethics* 

The purpose of cyberethics is to identify and analyze issues of ethical responsibility for computer/information technology (IT)professionals.  
Consider a computer professional's role in designing, developing, and maintaining computer hardware and software systems.  
Suppose a programmer discovers that a software product she has been working on is about to be released for sale to the public, even though it is unreliable because it contains “buggy” software.  
Should she “blow the whistle”?
