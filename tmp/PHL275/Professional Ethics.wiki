*Professional Ethics*  

Gotterbarn (1995) has suggested that computer ethics issues are professional ethics issues. 
Similar to medical ethics and legal ethics, which are tied to issues involving specific professions.
Computer ethics issues aren’t, strictly speaking, about technology per se. 
For example, he points out that we don’t have automobile ethics, airplane ethics, etc.
