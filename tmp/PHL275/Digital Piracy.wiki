Harry Flick is an undergraduate student at Pleasantville State College.
In many ways, Harryâ€™s interests are similar to those of typical students who aIend his college.
But Harry is also very fond of classic movies, especially films that were made before 1950.
DVD copies of these movies are difficult to find; those that are available tend to be expensive to purchase, and very few are available for loan at libraries.
One day, Harry discovers a Web site that has several classic films (in digital form) freely available for downloading.
Since the movies are sJll protected by copyright, however, Harry has some concerns about whether it would be permissible for him to download any of these films (even if only for private use).
