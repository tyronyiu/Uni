== What is Cyberethics? ==
The study of moral, legal and social issues involving cybertechnology.

As a field of applied ethics, it:
  * Examines the impact that cybertechnology has on our social, legal and moral systems.
  * Evaluates the social policies and laws that we frame in response to issues generated by the development and use of cybertechnology.

It refers to a wide range of computing and communication devices to the internet itself.

Cybertechnology include:
  * Digital electronic devices (network cameras)
  * Networked computers (including servers, phones, laptops etc.)
  * Stand-alone computers

Computer ethics limited either to:
  * Computing machines
  * Computing professionals
   
Internet ethics limited either to:
  * Ethical issues affecting (only) networked devices

== Computertechnology ==
Emerged late 1940s

=== First phase of computing technology - 1950s and 1960s ===
Mainly of huge mainframe computers that were unconnected (i.e. stand-alone machines).

=== phase two  - 1970s and 1980s ===
Generated three kinds of ethical issues:
  * Privacy concerns were exacerbated because confidential information could easily be exchanged between networked databases.
  * Intellectual property issues emergedbecausepersonal computers could easily be used to duplicate and  exchange proprietary softwareprograms.
  * Computer crime emerged because “hackers” could break into the computers of  large organization.
   
=== phase three - 1990 and present ===
The availability of internet access to the general public has increased significantly.
The profileration of internet and web-based technologies in this phase has raised ethical and social concerns affecting:
  * Free speech
  * Anonymity
  * Jurisdiction
   
=== Phase four - present to near-future ===
"Web 2.0” has made possible the proliferation of social networking sites (SNSs), such as Facebook and Twitter.
*Web 2.0* describes that the content is user generated.

Computers become more and more a part of who or what we  are as human beings.
Computers are becoming less visible as distinct entities, as they continue to be miniaturized and integrated into ordinary objects,  blend unobtrusively into  our surroundings.

Are there any unique issues emerging from solely cyberethics. 

[[Unique Ethical Issues?]]

*Policy Vacuums and Conceptual Muddles*

  * Unanticipated uses of computers have introduced policy vacuums 
  * The topic has to be fully understood before policy can be created. 
  * One solution might seem simply to fill the voids with new or revised policies. 
  * Some policy vacuums cannot easily be filled because of conceptual muddles. 
  * In these cases, conceptual muddles first need to be elucidated before clear policies can be formulated and justified. 

*A Policy Vacuum in Duplicating Software*

In the early 1980s there were no clear rules for  copying programs --> a policy vacuum arose. 
Before the policy vacuum could be filled, a conceptual muddle had to be elucidated: What, exactly, is software? 

[[Digital Piracy]]

*Cyberethics as a Branch of Applied Ethics*

  * Applied ethics, unlike theoretical ethics, examines "practical" ethical issues.  
  * It analyzes moral issues from the vantage-point of one or more ethical theories.  
  * Three distinct perspectives of applied ethics (as applied to cyberethics): 
    - Professional Ethics; 
    - Philosophical Ethics; 
    - Sociological/Descriptive Ethics.

[[Discussion Scenario]]


== Tue Sep 18 10:36:23 BST 2018 ==

*Ethics and Morality*

  * The term Ethics is derived from Ethos (Greek), and Morality from Mores (Latin).
  * Both terms translate roughly into notions affecting “custom,””habit,” and “behavior.”
  * Ethics is defined as the study of morality, which raises two questions: 
    * 1.What is morality? 
    * 2.What is the study of morality? 

*Moral Dilemmas and Moral Issues* 

  * Not every moral issue (or moral problem) that arises is (also) necessarily a moral dilemma. 
  * A dilemma is a situation where one must choose between two undesirable options, which often leads to one’s having to choose between “the lesser of two evils.”

*Moral Dilemmas vs. Moral Issues*

  * Not every dilemma is moral in nature.
  * The example of the “runaway trolley” (Scenario 2-1 in the textbook) illustrates a moral dilemma.
  * Most of the moral concerns/problems that we examine in this course are moral issues (as opposed to moral dilemmas).

[[The Runaway Trolley: A Classic Moral Dilemma]]

*What is Morality*

  * Morality can be defined as a system of rules for guiding human conduct, and principles for evaluating those rules.
  * Two points are worth noting in this:
    * morality is a system;
    * it is a system comprised of moral rules and principles.
  * Moral rules can be understood as "rules of conduct," which are very similar to "policies."
   
*Directives*
   
Directives are rules (of conduct) that guide our actions, and thus direct us to behave in certain ways.

Rules such as:
  * "Do not steal"
  * "Do not harm others"

Are examples of rules of conduct that direct us in our individual moral choices at the "microethical" level (i.e., the level of individual behavior).

*Social Policies*

Some rules of conduct guide our actions at the "macro-ethical" level by helping us frame social policies.

Rules such as:
  * “Proprietary software should not be copied“
  * “Software that can be used to invade the privacy of users should not be developed"

Are both examples of rules of conduct that arise out
of our social policies.

Notice the correlation between directives and
social policies (e.g., rules involving stealing).
 
*Principles* 

The rules of conduct in a moral system are evaluated by way of standards called principles.

For example, the principle of "social utility“ (i.e., promoting the greatest good for the greatest number) can be used to evaluate a social policy such as “Proprietary software should not be copied without permission." 

A policy, X, could be justified (on utilitarian grounds) by showing that following Policy X (i.e., not allowing the unauthorized copying of software) would produce more overall social utility (greater good for society).  

*Bernard Gert’s Scheme of a Moral*

According to Bernard Gert (2005), morality is a system that is:
  * like a game, but more like an informal game (e.g. a game of cards)
  * public (open and accessible to all)
  * rational (open to reason)
  * impartial (as illustrated in Gert’s “blindfold of justice”).

*The Role of Values in a Moral System*

Values can be viewed as objects of our desires or interests.
Examples of values include very general notions such happiness, love, freedom, etc.
Moral principles are ultimately derived from a society's system of values.

*Intrinsic vs. Instrumental Values*

Philosophers distinguish between two types of values: intrinsic and instrumental values.
Any value that serves some further end or good is called an instrumental value because it is tied to some external standard.
For example, cars, computers, and money are goods that have instrumental value.
Values such as life and happiness are intrinsic because they are valued for their own sake.

*Core Values*

Another approach to cataloguing values is to distinguish core values, some of which may or may not also be intrinsic values, from other kinds of values.
Moor (2004) argues that values such as life, happiness, and autonomy are core values because they are basic to a society's thriving and perhaps even to a society's survival.
Not all core values are also moral values.

*Three Schemes for Grounding the Evaluative Rules in a Moral System*
  
The principles are grounded in one of three
different kinds of schemes:
  * religion;
  * law;
  * philosophical ethics.
   
*Approach #1: Grounding Moral Principles in a Religious System*
    
Consider the following rationale for why stealing
is morally wrong:
    
Stealing is wrong because it offends God or because it violates one of God's (Ten) Commandments. (Christian Based)

From the point of view of institutionalized religion, stealing is wrong because of it offends God or because it violates the commands of a supreme authority.

*Approach #2: Grounding Moral Principles in a Legal System*

An alternative rationale would be:

Stealing is wrong because it violates the law.

Here the grounds for determining why stealing is wrong are not tied to religion.
If stealing violates a law in a particular nation or jurisdiction, then the act of stealing can be declared to be wrong independent of any religious beliefs that one may or may not happen to have.

*Approach #3: Grounding Moral Principles in a Philosophical System of Ethics*

A third way of approaching the question is:

Stealing is wrong because it is wrong (independent of any form of external authority or any external sanctions).  
On this view, the moral "rightness" or "wrongness" of stealing is not grounded in some external authoritative source.
It does not appeal to an external authority, either theological or legal, for justification.

Many philosophers and ethicists have argued
that:
  * Independent of either supernatural or legal authorities, reason alone is sufficient to show that stealing is wrong.
  * Reason can inform us that there is something either in the act of stealing itself, or in the consequences that result from this kind of act, that makes stealing morally wrong.

Social disapproval - no punishment in a formal sense.

*The Method of Philosophical Ethics*

Philosophers use normative method to analyze moral issues Social scientists use the descriptive method. 

Sociological and anthropological studies are descriptive because they describe or report how people in various cultures and groups behave with respect to the rules of a moral system.
For example, a sociologist might report that people who live in nations along the Pacific Rim believe that it is morally permissible to make copies of proprietary software for personal use.

*Discussion Stoppers as "Roadblocks" to Moral Discourse*

* People disagree about morality; so how can we reach agreement on moral issues?
* Who am I/Who are we to judge others and to impose my/our values on others?
* Isn't morality simply a private matter?
* Isn't morality simply a matter that different cultures and groups should determine for themselves?


*Discussion Stopper # 1: People Disagree on Solutions to Moral Issues*

People who hold this view fail to recognize:

* Experts in other fields of study, such as science and math, also disagree on what the correct answers to certain questions are.
* There is common agreement about answers to some moral questions.
* People do not always distinguish between "disagreements about factual matters" and "disagreements on general principles" in disputes involving morality.


*Discussion Stopper # 2: Who am I to Judge Others?*

We need to distinguish between:

“persons making judgments” and “persons being judgmental,“ and “judgments involving condemnations” vs.  “judgments involving evaluations.” 

Also, we are sometimes required to make
judgments about others.


*Discussion Stopper # 3: Ethics is Simply a Private Matter*

Many people assume that morality is
essentially personal in nature and that morality
must therefore be simply a private matter.
“Private morality" is essentially an oxymoron
or contradictory notion.
Morality is a public phenomenon (Gert).


*Discussion Stopper # 4: Morality is Simply a Matter for Individual Cultures to Decide*

A moral system is dependent on, or relative
to, a particular culture or group.
There are some very serious problems with
this view, which is called ethical relativism.
It is useful to distinguish between two
positions involving relativism:

cultural relativism, moral relativism.


*Discussion Stopper #4 Continued - Cultural Relativism*

At the base of cultural relativism is the
following assumption:

(A) Different cultures have different belief
systems about what constitutes morally right and
wrong behavior.

Note that (A) is essentially a descriptive thesis.

Even if cultural relativism (Thesis A) is true, we
can ask if (A) logically implies the claim

(B) No universal standard of morality is possible
(because what is morally right or wrong can only be
determined only by some culture or group).

Note that (B), unlike (A), is a normative thesis.
Also note that move from (A) to (B) is to move
from cultural relativism to moral relativism.


*Moral Relativism*

Moral relativists make a questionable move:

Premise: Different cultures have different beliefs
about what is right and wrong
Conclusion: No universal standard of morality is
possible.

Many moral relativists also seem to suggest that,
in matters of morality, “anything goes.”
But the moral relativist’s view is essentially
incoherent and inconsistent.
Does it follow that individuals who reside outside a
particular culture, X, can never make any judgments
about the behavior of those who live within X?

Consider that in many tribes in West Africa a ritual of
female circumcision is still practiced.
While this practice has been a tradition for many
generations, some females living in tribes that still
perform this ritual on teenage girls have objected.
Many people who live outside these cultures condemn
this practice as it is carried out today.
Are they wrong in condemning this practice?
Assume that the majority of residents in Culture X approve of
female circumcision.
Would it be inappropriate for those who lived outside of West
Africa to claim that the treatment of young women in those
tribes is morally wrong, simply because they are not members of
Culture X?

Thus, Moral Relativism must be the opposite of Moral Absolutism. 
A spectral and even subjective perception of Morality vs. a absolute and measureable perception of Morality.


*Moral Objectivism vs. Moral Absolutism*

* Moral absolutism
* Moral objectivism

There is only one uniquely correct answer to every
moral problem.
(for at least some moral issues) there can be more
than one acceptable answer, so long as rational
standards apply.

Gert notes that while there may not be only one
uniquely correct answer to every moral problem,
there are can be incorrect answers to many of
these problems.


*Example: The Perils of Moral Relativism*

Two cultures, Culture A and Culture B, adjoin each other
geographically. The members of Culture A are fairly peaceful
people, tolerant of the diverse beliefs found in all other
cultures. And they believe that all cultures should essentially
mind their own business when it comes to maEers involving
morality. Those in Culture B, on the contrary, dislike and are
hostile to those outside their culture.
Culture B has recently developed a new computer system for
delivering chemical weapons that it plans to use in military
aEacks on other cultures, including Culture A.
Since Culture A subscribes to the view of moral relativism,
and thus must respect the views of all cultures with regard to
their systems of moral beliefs, can it condemn, in a logically
consistent manner, Culture B’s actions as immoral?

*The Structure of Ethical Theories*

An essential feature of theory in general is
that it guides us in our investigations.
In science, theory provides us with some
general principles and structures to analyze
our data.
The purpose of ethical theory, like scientific
theory, is to provide a framework for
analyzing issues.
Ideally, a good theory should be coherent,
consistent, comprehensive, and systematic.


*Why Do we Need Ethical Theories?*

Ethical theories can help us to avoid inconsistent reasoning in our thinking about moral issues and moral dilemmas.
Recall again the runaway trolley scenario, but now imagine a variation of it in which victims of the trolley accident are taken to the hospital and only limited resources are available to the accident victims.
Which moral principle would you use in deciding who receives medical assistance and who does not?
Can you also apply that principal consistently across similar cases?


*Why Do we Need Ethical Theories?*

Imagine that as a result of the accident, The people are rushed to the hospital.
Each patient, whose condition is “critical,” is in need of a vital human organ to live, and there is not sufficient time to get these organs from a transplant donor bank located outside the hospital.
Also, the hospital happens to be under stated with surgeons at the time the accident victims are admiEed to the emergency ward.
So a medical physician (Dr. Smith) on duty at the hospital, who is administering a post-surgery physical exam to a patient in one room, is suddenly called into the emergency room.
Dr. Smith determines that one patient needs a heart, and another a kidney; a third patient needs a liver; a fourth,a pancreas; a pair of lungs.
Smith also determines that unless the victims receive the organ transplants immediately, each will die.
Then it suddenly occurs to Dr. Smith that the hospital patient on whom he had been conducting the physical exam is in excellent health.
If the healthy patient’s organs were removed and immediately given to each accident victim, all would live .
Of course, the healthy patient would die as a result.
But the net erect would be that four more humans would live.
What should Smith do in this case?
What would you do if you were in the doctor’s shoes?
Four Kinds of Ethical Theories We organize ethical theories into four broad?

Categories:

* Consequence-based,
* Duty-based,
* Contract-based,
* Character-based.


*Consequence-based Ethical Theories*

The primary goal of a moral system is to produce desirable consequences or outcomes for its members.
The consequences (i.e., the ends achieved) of actions and policies that provide the ultimate standard against which moral decisions must be evaluated.
So if choosing between acts A or B, the morally correct action will be the one that produces the most desirable outcome.
In determining the best outcome, we can ask the question, whose outcome?


*According to the utilitarian theory:*

An individual act (X) or a social policy (Y) is morally permissible if the consequences that result from (X) or (Y) produce the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of persons affected by the act or policy.

*Utilitarians draw on two key points in defending their theory:*

The principle of social utility should be used to determine morality;

Social utility can be measured by the amount of happiness produced for society as a whole.


*Act Utilitarianism*

According to act utilitarians:

An act, X, is morally permissible, if the consequences produced by doing X results in the greatest good for the greatest number of people, affected by X.


*A Controversial Policy in Newmerica*

A policy is under consideration in a legislative body in the nation of Newmerica, where 1% of the population would be forced to work as slaves in a manufacturing facility to produce computer chips.

Proponents of this policy argue that, if enacted into law, it would result in lower prices for electronic devices for consumers in Newmerica.
They argue that it would also likely result in more overall happiness for the nation’s citizens because the remaining 99% of the population, who are not enslaved, would be able to purchase electronic devices and other computer-based products at a much lower price.
Hence, 99% of Newmerica’s population benefit at the expense of the remaining 1%.

This policy clearly seems consistent with the principle of producing the greatest good for the greatest number of Newmerica’s population, but should it be enacted into law?  


*Criticism of Act Utilitarianism*

Critics reject the emphasis on the consequence of individual acts.
In our day-to-day activities, we tend not to deliberate on each individual action as if that action were unique.
Instead, we are inclined to deliberate on the basis of certain principles or general rules that guide our behavior.  

Each time that you enter a store, do you ask
yourself the following question: “Shall I steal
[[item]] X in at this particular time?"
Or, have you already formulated certain
general principles that guide your individual
actions, such as a principle to the effect: "It is
never morally permissible to steal."

---------------------------------

*Rule Utilitarianism*

Some utilitarians argue that it is the
consequences that result from following rules
or principles, not the consequences of
individual acts, that are important.
According to rule utilitarianism:

An act, X, is morally permissible if the
consequences of following the general rule (Y),
of which act X is an instance, would bring about
the greatest good for the greatest number.

----------------------------------

*Runaway Trolley*

* How would a rule utlitarian reason in the case of the
trolley accident involving the victms each of whom
needs an organ transplant to survive?

* For an (extreme) act utilitarian, the decision might be
quite simple: remove the the organs from the one
healthy patent (even though he will die) so that the
humans who otherwise would die could now live.

* But would a rule utlitarian see this particular action as
justifiable on rule-utilitarian grounds—i.e., could it
form the basis for an acceptable policy (in general) for
hospitals and medical facilities?

----------------------------

*Criticism of Rule Utilitarianism*

Utilitarian theory:

morality is ultimately tied to happiness or
pleasure;
morality can ultimately be determined by
consequences (of either acts or policies).

Critics of utilitarianism ague that morality can
be grounded neither in consequences nor in
happiness.

*Four Kinds of Ethical Theories*

We organize ethical theories into four broad:
- categories:
- Consequence-based,
- Duty-based,
- Contract-based,
- Character-based.

*Duty-based Ethical Theories*

Immanuel Kant argued that morality must ultimately be grounded in the concept of duty or obligations that humans have to one another.

For Kant,

Morality can never be grounded in the consequences of human actions.
Morality has nothing to do with the promotion of happiness or the achievement of desirable consequences.

Theories in which the notion of duty, or obligation, serve a foundation for morality are called deontological theories.
They derive their meaning from the Greek root deon, which means duty.
Kant defends his ethical theory on the grounds that:

Humans are rational, autonomous agents;
Human beings are ends-in-themselves, and not means
to ends.

*Rule Deontology*

For Kant, morality conforms to a standard or objective test, a principle that he calls the Categorical Imperative.

Kant's imperative has a number of variations, one of which directs us to:

Act always on that maxim or principle (or rule) which ensures that all individuals will be treated as ends-in-themselves and never merely as a means to an end.

*Categorical Imperative*

Categorical imperative, would lead to a system based on two essential principles:

- universality
- impartiality

Every individual would be treated fairly since the same rules would apply universally to all persons.
Categorical imperative has been criticized because it cannot help us in cases where we have two or more conflicting duties

*Criticisms of Rule Deontology*

Example: We have duties to both keep promises and to tell the truth, and sometimes we encounter situations in which we are required either to:

Tell the truth and break a promise or to keep a promise and tell a lie.

Kant does not provide us with a mechanism for resolving such conflicts.

*Act Deontology*

David Ross argues that when two or more moral duties clash, we have to look at the individual situation (or “circumstance”) to determine which duty is overriding.

Like act utilitarians, Ross stresses the importance of analyzing individual actions and situations to determine the morally appropriate course of action to take.

Unlike utilitarians, Ross believes that we must not consider the consequences of actions when deliberating over which course of action morally trumps or outweighs another.

Ross believes that certain prima facie (or selfevident) duties which, "all things being equal," must be followed.

Prima facie duties such as honesty, benevolence, justice, etc.

Example: We have a prima facie duty not to lie and a prima facie duty to keep a promise.
If there are no conflicts in a given situation, then each prima facie duty is also an actual duty.

We can determine what our overriding duty is in a particular situation by using a two-step deliberative process:

Reflect on the competing prima facie duties, weigh the evidence at hand to determine which course of action would be required in a particular circumstance.

*A Dilemma Involving conflicting duties*

You promise to meet a classmate one evening at 7:00 in the college library to study together for a midterm exam for a course you are taking.
 While driving in your car to the library, you receive a call on your mobile phone informing you that your grandmother has been taken to the hospital and that you should go immediately to the hospital.
You consider calling your classmate from your car, but you realize that you don’t have his phone number.
 You also realize that you don’t have time to try to reach your classmate by e-mail
 
 What should you do in this case?  

For a rule deontologist (Kant), the answer is unclear as to what you should do in this scenario, since you have two absolute duties.
For Ross, however, the following procedure for deliberation is used.

You would have to weigh between the two prima facie duties in question to determine which will be your actual duty in this particular circumstance.

In weighing between the two conflicting duties, your actual duty in this situation would be to visit your grandmother, which means, of course, that you would have to break your promise to your friend.

However, in a different kind of situation involving a conflict of the same two duties, your actual duty might be to keep the promise made to your friend and not visit your grandmother in the hospital.

*Scenario*

In analyzing the following scenario, describe how an act utilitarian, a rule utilitarian, a rule deontologist, and an act deontologist would each reach a solution to this dilemma.

_Which solution seems most plausible?_

_Work in pairs_

*Scenario*

You have just been appointed to the board of directors of XYZ.com.
Unfortunately, the dot-com company has been experiencing some difficult financial times, resulting in revenue losses in three of the last four quarters.
As you assume your new position, you discover that two proposals are on the table.
Each proposal has been put forth as a means for dealing with XYZ’s immediate financial problems.

_Proposal #1_ recommends that all employees be retained, but that an immediate freeze on salary increases (raises) for all employees be imposed for the next six months. (Employees may even be asked to take a 5% cut in pay if things do not improve by the end of that period.)

_Proposal #2_ recommends that wages not be frozen, but that 5% of the XYZ’s work force be laid off. 
(One piece of reasoning behind this proposal is that taking more drastic measures will “protect” 95% of XYZ’s workers and will send a message to Wall Street and local investors that XYZ is serious about improving its financial position and that it will soon be a stable company once again.)

The board is evenly split, seven members favoring proposal# 1 and seven favoring proposal #2. Yours will be the tie-breaking vote.

*Contract-based Ethical Theories*

The social-contract model gives us a motivation for being moral.

For example, it is in our individual self-interest to develop a moral system with rules (Pojman 2006).

Motivation for establishing a moral system is absent in both the utilitarian or deontological theories.
Contract-based ethical theory seems to have one advantage over them.

*Criticisms of Social Contract Theory*

Social-contract theory provides for only a minimalist morality.

It is minimalist in the sense that we are obligated to behave morally only where an explicit or formal contract exists (Pojman 2006).

Many situations involving morality where are no express contracts or explicit laws describing our obligations to each other.
Most of us also believe that in at least some of these cases, we are morally obligated to help others when it is in our power to do so.

Philosophers differentiate between two kinds of legal rights:

- positive rights
- negative rights.

Having a negative right to something means simply that one has the right not to be interfered with in carrying out the privileges associated with that right.

For example, your right to vote and your right to own a computer are both negative rights.

Positive rights are very rare and are much more difficult to justify philosophically.
One's right to receive an education is a positive right.

Because all citizens are entitled to such an education, they must be provided with a free public education.
If education requires Internet access at home, should students also be provided with free Internet access?

*Character-based Ethical Theories*

Virtue ethics(also sometimes called "character
ethics")

Ignores the roles that consequences, duties, and social contracts play in moral systems in determining the appropriate standard for evaluating moral behavior.
focuses on criteria having to do with the character development of individuals and their acquisition of good character traits from the kinds of habits they develop.

Instead of asking, “What should I do in such and such a situation?", a virtue ethicist asks:

“What kind of person should I be?"

The emphasis is on being a moral person not simply understanding what moral rules are and how they apply in certain situations. 
Virtue ethics is "agent-oriented”

*Criticism of Character-based Ethical Theories*

Character-based ethical systems tend to flourish in cultures where there is a greater emphasis placed on community life than on individuals.

In the West, since the Enlightenment, more emphasis has been placed on the importance of individual autonomy and individual rights.
In the Ancient Greek world of Aristotle's time, the notion of community was paramount.

*Summary - Four Types of Ethical Theory Type of Theory*

- Advantages
- Disadvantages
- Consequence-based (Utilitarian)
- Stresses promotion of
- happiness and utility
- Ignores concerns of justice for the minority population
