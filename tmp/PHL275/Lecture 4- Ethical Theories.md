## Discussion Stoppers as "Roadblocks" to Moral Discourse

People disagree about morality;
so how can we reach agreement on moral issues?
Who am I/Who are we to judge others and to impose my/our values on others?
Isn't morality simply a private matter?
Isn't morality simply a matter that different cultures and groups should determine for themselves?

## Discussion Stopper # 1: People Disagree on Solutions to Moral Issues

People who hold this view fail to recognize:

Experts in other fields of study, such as science and math, also disagree on what the correct answers to certain questions are.
There is common agreement about answers to some moral questions.
People do not always distinguish between "disagreements about factual matters" and "disagreements on general principles" in disputes involving morality.

## Discussion Stopper # 2: Who am I to Judge Others?

We need to distinguish between:

“persons making judgments” and “persons being judgmental,“ and “judgments involving condemnations” vs.  “judgments involving evaluations.”

Also, we are sometimes required to make judgments about others.

## Discussion Stopper # 3: Ethics is Simply a Private Matter

Many people assume that morality is essentially personal in nature and that morality must therefore be simply a private matter.
“Private morality" is essentially an oxymoron or contradictory notion.
Morality is a public phenomenon (Gert).

## Discussion Stopper # 4: Morality is Simply a Matter for Individual Cultures to Decide

A moral system is dependent on, or relative to, a particular culture or group.
There are some very serious problems with this view, which is called ethical relativism.
It is useful to distinguish between two positions involving relativism:

* Cultural relativism
* Moral relativism.


## Discussion Stopper #4 Continued - Cultural Relativism

At the base of cultural relativism is the following assumption:

> (A) Different cultures have different belief systems about what constitutes morally right and wrong behavior.

*Note that (A) is essentially a descriptive thesis.*

Even if cultural relativism (Thesis A) is true, we can ask if (A) logically implies the claim

> (B) No universal standard of morality is possible (because what is morally right or wrong can only be determined only by some culture or group).

*Note that (B), unlike (A), is a normative thesis.
Also note that move from (A) to (B) is to move from cultural relativism to moral relativism.*

## Moral Relativism

Moral relativists make a questionable move:

Premise: Different cultures have different beliefs about what is right and wrong Conclusion:
No universal standard of morality is possible.

Many moral relativists also seem to suggest that, in matters of morality, “anything goes.”
But the moral relativist’s view is essentially incoherent and inconsistent.
Does it follow that individuals who reside outside a particular culture, X, can never make any judgments about the behavior of those who live within X?

Consider that in many tribes in West Africa a ritual of female circumcision is still practiced.
While this practice has been a tradition for many generations, some females living in tribes that still perform this ritual on teenage girls have objected.
Many people who live outside these cultures condemn this practice as it is carried out today.
Are they wrong in condemning this practice?
Assume that the majority of residents in Culture X approve of female circumcision.
Would it be inappropriate for those who lived outside of West Africa to claim that the treatment of young women in those tribes is morally wrong, simply because they are not members of Culture X?

## Moral Objectivism vs. Moral Absolutism

There is only one uniquely correct answer to every moral problem.
(for at least some moral issues) there can be more than one acceptable answer, so long as rational standards apply.

Gert notes that while there may not be only one uniquely correct answer to every moral problem, there are can be incorrect answers to many of these problems.

## Example: The Perils of Moral Relativism

Two cultures, Culture A and Culture B, adjoin each other geographically.
The members of Culture A are fairly peaceful people, tolerant of the diverse beliefs found in all other cultures.
And they believe that all cultures should essentially mind their own business when it comes to maEers involving morality.
Those in Culture B, on the contrary, dislike and are hostile to those outside their culture.
Culture B has recently developed a new computer system for delivering chemical weapons that it plans to use in military aEacks on other cultures, including Culture A.
Since Culture A subscribes to the view of moral relativism, and thus must respect the views of all cultures with regard to their systems of moral beliefs, can it condemn, in a logically consistent manner, Culture B’s actions as immoral?

## The Structure of Ethical Theories

An essential feature of theory in general is that it guides us in our investigations.
In science, theory provides us with some general principles and structures to analyze our data.
The purpose of ethical theory, like scientific theory, is to provide a framework for analyzing issues.
Ideally, a good theory should be coherent, consistent, comprehensive, and systematic.

## Why Do we Need Ethical Theories?

Ethical theories can help us to avoid inconsistent reasoning in our thinking about moral issues and moral dilemmas.
Recall again the runaway trolley scenario, but now imagine a variation of it in which victims of the trolley accident are taken to the hospital and only limited resources are available to the accident victims.
Which moral principle would you use in deciding who receives medical assistance and who does not?
Can you also apply that principal consistently across similar cases?


Imagine that as a result of the accident, have people are rushed to the hospital.
Each patient, whose condition is “critical,” is in need of a vital human organ to live, and there is not sufficient time to get these organs from a transplant donor bank located outside the hospital.
Also, the hospital happens to be under stated with surgeons at the time the accident victims are admired to the emergency ward.
So a medical physician (Dr. Smith) on duty at the hospital, who is administering a post-surgery physical exam to a patient in one room, is suddenly called into the emergency room.
Dr. Smith determines that one patient needs a heart, and another a kidney; a third patient needs a liver; a fourth,a pancreas; a pair of lungs.
Smith also determines that unless the victims receive the organ transplants immediately, each will die.
Then it suddenly occurs to Dr. Smith that the hospital patient on whom he had been conducting the physical exam is in excellent health.
If the healthy patient’s organs were removed and immediately given to each accident victim, all have would live .
Of course, the healthy patient would die as a result.
But the net eject would be that four more humans would live.
What should Smith do in this case?
What would you do if you were in the doctor’s shoes?  

## Four Kinds of Ethical Theories

We organize ethical theories into four broad categories:

* Consequence-based,
* Duty-based,
* Contract-based,
* Character-based.

## Consequence-based Ethical Theories

The primary goal of a moral system is to produce desirable consequences or outcomes for its members.
The consequences (i.e., the ends achieved) of actions and policies that provide the ultimate standard against which moral decisions must be evaluated.
So if choosing between acts A or B, the morally correct action will be the one that produces the most desirable outcome.
In determining the best outcome, we can ask the question, whose outcome?

### According to the utilitarian theory:

An individual act (X) or a social policy (Y) is morally permissible if the consequences that result from (X) or (Y) produce the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of persons affected by the act or policy.

### Utilitarians draw on two key points in defending their theory:

The principle of social utility should be used to determine morality;
social utility can be measured by the amount of happiness produced for society as a whole.

## Act Utilitarianism

### According to act utilitarians:

An act, X, is morally permissible if the consequences produced by doing X result in the greatest good for the greatest number of persons affected by X.

### A Controversial Policy in Newmerica

* A policy is under consideration in a legislative body in the nation of Newmerica, where 1% of the popula4on would be forced to work as slaves in a manufacturing facility to produce computer chips.

* Proponents of this policy argue that, if enacted into law, it would result in lower prices for electronic devices for consumers in Newmerica. They argue that it would also likely result in more overall happiness for the nation’s citizens because the remaining 99% of the population, who are not enslaved, would be able to purchase electronic devices and other computer-based products at a much lower price. Hence, 99% of Newmerica’s population benefit at the expense of the remaining 1%.

* This policy clearly seems consistent with the principle of producing the greatest good for the greatest number of Newmerica’s populatton, but should it be enacted into law?


## Criticism of Act Utilitarianism

Critics reject the emphasis on the consequence of individual acts.
In our day-to-day activities, we tend not to deliberate on each individual action as if that action were unique.
Instead, we are inclined to deliberate on the basis of certain principles or general rules that guide our behavior.

Each time that you enter a store, do you ask yourself the following question:
“Shall I steal item X in at this particular time?"
Or, have you already formulated certain general principles that guide your individual actions, such as a principle to the effect:
"It is never morally permissible to steal."

## Rule Utilitarianism

Some utilitarians argue that it is the consequences that result from following rules or principles, not the consequences of individual acts, that are important.

### According to rule utilitarianism:

An act, X, is morally permissible if the consequences of following the general rule (Y), of which act X is an instance, would bring about the greatest good for the greatest number.

## Runaway Trolley

* How would a rule utlitarian reason in the case of the trolley accident involving the victms each of whom needs an organ transplant to survive?

* For an (extreme) act utilitarian, the decision might be quite simple: remove the the organs from the one healthy patent (even though he will die) so that the humans who otherwise would die could now live.

* But would a rule utlitarian see this particular action as justifiable on rule-u4litarian grounds—i.e., could it form the basis for an acceptable policy (in general) for hospitals and medical facilities?

## Criticism of Rule Utilitarianism

### Utilitarian theory:

Morality is ultimately tied to happiness or pleasure;
Morality can ultimately be determined by consequences (of either acts or policies).

Critics of utilitarianism ague that morality can be grounded neither in consequences nor in happiness.
