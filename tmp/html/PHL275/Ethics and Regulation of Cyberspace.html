<p>
The study of moral, legal and social issues involving cybertechnology.
</p>

<p>
As a field of applied ethics, it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Examines the impact that cybertechnology has on our social, legal and moral systems.

<li>
Evaluates the social policies and laws that we frame in response to issues generated by the development and use of cybertechnology.

</ul>

<p>
It refers to a wide range of computing and communication devices to the internet itself.
</p>

<p>
Cybertechnology include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Digital electronic devices (network cameras)

<li>
Networked computers (including servers, phones, laptops etc.)

<li>
Stand-alone computers

</ul>

<p>
Computer ethics limited either to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Computing machines

<li>
Computing professionals

</ul>
   
<p>
Internet ethics limited either to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Ethical issues affecting (only) networked devices

</ul>

Generated three kinds of ethical issues:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Privacy concerns were exacerbated because confidential information could easily be exchanged between networked databases.

<li>
Intellectual property issues emergedbecausepersonal computers could easily be used to duplicate and  exchange proprietary softwareprograms.

<li>
Computer crime emerged because “hackers” could break into the computers of  large organization.

</ul>
   
<div id="Ethics and Regulation of Cyberspace-Computertechnology-phase three - 1990 and present"><h3 id="phase three - 1990 and present">phase three - 1990 and present</h3></div>
<p>
The availability of internet access to the general public has increased significantly.
The profileration of internet and web-based technologies in this phase has raised ethical and social concerns affecting:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Free speech

<li>
Anonymity

<li>

</p>

<ul>
<li>
Unanticipated uses of computers have introduced policy vacuums 

<li>
The topic has to be fully understood before policy can be created. 

<li>
One solution might seem simply to fill the voids with new or revised policies. 

<li>
Some policy vacuums cannot easily be filled because of conceptual muddles. 

<li>
In these cases, conceptual muddles first need to be elucidated before clear policies can be formulated and justified.

<span id="Ethics and Regulation of Cyberspace-Tue Sep 18 10:36:23 BST 2018-Ethics and Morality"></span><strong id="Ethics and Morality">Ethics and Morality</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The term Ethics is derived from Ethos (Greek), and Morality from Mores (Latin).

<li>
Both terms translate roughly into notions affecting “custom,””habit,” and “behavior.”

<li>
Ethics is defined as the study of morality, which raises two questions: 

<ul>
<li>
1.What is morality? 

<li>
2.What is the study of morality? 

</ul>
</ul>

<span id="Ethics and Regulation of Cyberspace-Tue Sep 18 10:36:23 BST 2018-Moral Dilemmas and Moral Issues"></span><strong id="Moral Dilemmas and Moral Issues">Moral Dilemmas and Moral Issues</strong> 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Not every moral issue (or moral problem) that arises is (also) necessarily a moral dilemma. 

<li>
A dilemma is a situation where one must choose between two undesirable options, which often leads to one’s having to choose between “the lesser of two evils.”

</ul>

<p>
<span id="Ethics and Regulation of Cyberspace-Tue Sep 18 10:36:23 BST 2018-Moral Dilemmas vs. Moral Issues"></span><strong id="Moral Dilemmas vs. Moral Issues">Moral Dilemmas vs. Moral Issues</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Not every dilemma is moral in nature.

<li>
The example of the “runaway trolley” (Scenario 2-1 in the textbook) illustrates a moral dilemma.

<li>
Most of the moral concerns/problems that we examine in this course are moral issues (as opposed to moral dilemmas).

</ul>

<p>
<span id="Ethics and Regulation of Cyberspace-Tue Sep 18 10:36:23 BST 2018-What is Morality"></span><strong id="What is Morality">What is Morality</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Morality can be defined as a system of rules for guiding human conduct, and principles for evaluating those rules.

<li>
Two points are worth noting in this:

<ul>
<li>
morality is a system;

<li>
it is a system comprised of moral rules and principles.

</ul>
<li>
Moral rules can be understood as "rules of conduct," which are very similar to "policies."

</ul>
   
<p>
<span id="Ethics and Regulation of Cyberspace-Tue Sep 18 10:36:23 BST 2018-Directives"></span><strong id="Directives">Directives</strong>
</p>
   
<p>
Directives are rules (of conduct) that guide our actions, and thus direct us to behave in certain ways.
</p>

<p>
Rules such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
"Do not steal"

<li>
"Do not harm others"

</ul>

<p>
Are examples of rules of conduct that direct us in our individual moral choices at the "microethical" level (i.e., the level of individual behavior).
</p>

<p>
<span id="Ethics and Regulation of Cyberspace-Tue Sep 18 10:36:23 BST 2018-Social Policies"></span><strong id="Social Policies">Social Policies</strong>
</p>

<p>
Some rules of conduct guide our actions at the "macro-ethical" level by helping us frame social policies.
</p>

<p>
Rules such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
“Proprietary software should not be copied“

<li>
“Software that can be used to invade the privacy of users should not be developed"

</ul>

<p>
Are both examples of rules of conduct that arise out
of our social policies.
</p>

<p>
Notice the correlation between directives and
social policies (e.g., rules involving stealing).
</p>
 
<p>
<span id="Ethics and Regulation of Cyberspace-Tue Sep 18 10:36:23 BST 2018-Principles"></span><strong id="Principles">Principles</strong> 
</p>

<p>
The rules of conduct in a moral system are evaluated by way of standards called principles.
</p>

<p>
For example, the principle of "social utility“ (i.e., promoting the greatest good for the greatest number) can be used to evaluate a social policy such as “Proprietary software should not be copied without permission." 
</p>

<p>
A policy, X, could be justified (on utilitarian grounds) by showing that following Policy X (i.e., not allowing the unauthorized copying of software) would produce more overall social utility (greater good for society).

</p>

<p>
According to Bernard Gert (2005), morality is a system that is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
like a game, but more like an informal game (e.g. a game of cards)

<li>
public (open and accessible to all)

<li>
rational (open to reason)

<li>
impartial (as illustrated in Gert’s “blindfold of justice”).

</ul>

</p>

<p>
Values can be viewed as objects of our desires or interests.
Examples of values include very general notions such happiness, love, freedom, etc.
Moral principles are ultimately derived from a society's system of values.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Ethics and Regulation of Cyberspace-Tue Sep 18 10:36:23 BST 2018-Intrinsic vs. Instrumental Values"></span><strong id="Intrinsic vs. Instrumental Values">Intrinsic vs. Instrumental Values</strong>
</p>

<p>
Philosophers distinguish between two types of values: intrinsic and instrumental values.
Any value that serves some further end or good is called an instrumental value because it is tied to some external standard.
For example, cars, computers, and money are goods that have instrumental value.
Values such as life and happiness are intrinsic because they are valued for their own sake.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Ethics and Regulation of Cyberspace-Tue Sep 18 10:36:23 BST 2018-Core Values"></span><strong id="Core Values">Core Values</strong>
</p>

<p>
Another approach to cataloguing values is to distinguish core values, some of which may or may not also be intrinsic values, from other kinds of values.
Moor (2004) argues that values such as life, happiness, and autonomy are core values because they are basic to a society's thriving and perhaps even to a society's survival.
Not all core values are also moral values.

</p>
  
<p>
The principles are grounded in one of three
different kinds of schemes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
religion;

<li>
law;

<li>
philosophical ethics.

</ul>
   
<p>

</p>
    
<p>
Consider the following rationale for why stealing
is morally wrong:
</p>
    
<p>
Stealing is wrong because it offends God or because it violates one of God's (Ten) Commandments. (Christian Based)
</p>

<p>
From the point of view of institutionalized religion, stealing is wrong because of it offends God or because it violates the commands of a supreme authority.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Ethics and Regulation of Cyberspace-Tue Sep 18 10:36:23 BST 2018-Approach #2: Grounding Moral Principles in a Legal System"></span><strong id="Approach #2: Grounding Moral Principles in a Legal System">Approach #2: Grounding Moral Principles in a Legal System</strong>
</p>

<p>
An alternative rationale would be:
</p>

<p>
Stealing is wrong because it violates the law.
</p>

<p>
Here the grounds for determining why stealing is wrong are not tied to religion.
If stealing violates a law in a particular nation or jurisdiction, then the act of stealing can be declared to be wrong independent of any religious beliefs that one may or may not happen to have.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Ethics and Regulation of Cyberspace-Tue Sep 18 10:36:23 BST 2018-Approach #3: Grounding Moral Principles in a Philosophical System of Ethics"></span><strong id="Approach #3: Grounding Moral Principles in a Philosophical System of Ethics">Approach #3: Grounding Moral Principles in a Philosophical System of Ethics</strong>
</p>

<p>
A third way of approaching the question is:
</p>

<p>
Stealing is wrong because it is wrong (independent of any form of external authority or any external sanctions).  
On this view, the moral "rightness" or "wrongness" of stealing is not grounded in some external authoritative source.
It does not appeal to an external authority, either theological or legal, for justification.
</p>

<p>
Many philosophers and ethicists have argued
that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Independent of either supernatural or legal authorities, reason alone is sufficient to show that stealing is wrong.

<li>
Reason can inform us that there is something either in the act of stealing itself, or in the consequences that result from this kind of act, that makes stealing morally wrong.

</ul>

<p>
Social disapproval - no punishment in a formal sense.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Ethics and Regulation of Cyberspace-Tue Sep 18 10:36:23 BST 2018-The Method of Philosophical Ethics"></span><strong id="The Method of Philosophical Ethics">The Method of Philosophical Ethics</strong>
</p>

<p>
Philosophers use normative method to analyze moral issues Social scientists use the descriptive method. 
</p>

<p>
Sociological and anthropological studies are descriptive because they describe or report how people in various cultures and groups behave with respect to the rules of a moral system.
For example, a sociologist might report that people who live in nations along the Pacific Rim believe that it is morally permissible to make copies of proprietary software for personal use.

<p>
People who hold this view fail to recognize:

<ul>
<li>
Experts in other fields of study, such as science and math, also disagree on what the correct answers to certain questions are.

<li>
There is common agreement about answers to some moral questions.

<li>
People do not always distinguish between "disagreements about factual matters" and "disagreements on general principles" in disputes involving morality.

</p>

<p>
We need to distinguish between:
</p>

<p>
“persons making judgments” and “persons being judgmental,“ and “judgments involving condemnations” vs.  “judgments involving evaluations.” 
</p>

<p>
Also, we are sometimes required to make

</p>

<p>
Many people assume that morality is
essentially personal in nature and that morality
must therefore be simply a private matter.
“Private morality" is essentially an oxymoron
or contradictory notion.
Morality is a public phenomenon (Gert).

</p>

<p>
A moral system is dependent on, or relative
to, a particular culture or group.
There are some very serious problems with
this view, which is called ethical relativism.
It is useful to distinguish between two
positions involving relativism:
</p>

<p>
cultural relativism, moral relativism.
</p>


<p>
<span id="Ethics and Regulation of Cyberspace-Thu Sep 20 10:27:07 BST 2018-Discussion Stopper #4 Continued - Cultural Relativism"></span><strong id="Discussion Stopper #4 Continued - Cultural Relativism">Discussion Stopper #4 Continued - Cultural Relativism</strong>
</p>

<p>
At the base of cultural relativism is the
following assumption:
</p>

<p>
(A) Different cultures have different belief
systems about what constitutes morally right and
wrong behavior.
</p>

<p>
Note that (A) is essentially a descriptive thesis.
</p>

<p>
Even if cultural relativism (Thesis A) is true, we
can ask if (A) logically implies the claim
</p>

<p>
(B) No universal standard of morality is possible
(because what is morally right or wrong can only be
determined only by some culture or group).
</p>

<p>
Note that (B), unlike (A), is a normative thesis.
Also note that move from (A) to (B) is to move
from cultural relativism to moral relativism.
</p>


<p>
<span id="Ethics and Regulation of Cyberspace-Thu Sep 20 10:27:07 BST 2018-Moral Relativism"></span><strong id="Moral Relativism">Moral Relativism</strong>
</p>

<p>
Moral relativists make a questionable move:
</p>

<p>
Premise: Different cultures have different beliefs
about what is right and wrong
Conclusion: No universal standard of morality is
possible.
</p>

<p>
Many moral relativists also seem to suggest that,
in matters of morality, “anything goes.”
But the moral relativist’s view is essentially
incoherent and inconsistent.
Does it follow that individuals who reside outside a
particular culture, X, can never make any judgments
about the behavior of those who live within X?
</p>

<p>
Consider that in many tribes in West Africa a ritual of
female circumcision is still practiced.
While this practice has been a tradition for many
generations, some females living in tribes that still
perform this ritual on teenage girls have objected.
Many people who live outside these cultures condemn
this practice as it is carried out today.
Are they wrong in condemning this practice?
Assume that the majority of residents in Culture X approve of
female circumcision.
Would it be inappropriate for those who lived outside of West
Africa to claim that the treatment of young women in those
tribes is morally wrong, simply because they are not members of
Culture X?
</p>

<p>
Thus, Moral Relativism must be the opposite of Moral Absolutism. 
A spectral and even subjective perception of Morality vs. a absolute and measureable perception of Morality.
</p>

</p>

<ul>
<li>
Moral absolutism

<li>
Moral objectivism

</ul>

<p>
There is only one uniquely correct answer to every
moral problem.
(for at least some moral issues) there can be more
than one acceptable answer, so long as rational
standards apply.
</p>

<p>
Gert notes that while there may not be only one
uniquely correct answer to every moral problem,
there are can be incorrect answers to many of
these problems.

</p>

<p>
Two cultures, Culture A and Culture B, adjoin each other
geographically. The members of Culture A are fairly peaceful
people, tolerant of the diverse beliefs found in all other
cultures. And they believe that all cultures should essentially
mind their own business when it comes to maEers involving
morality. Those in Culture B, on the contrary, dislike and are
hostile to those outside their culture.
Culture B has recently developed a new computer system for
delivering chemical weapons that it plans to use in military
aEacks on other cultures, including Culture A.
Since Culture A subscribes to the view of moral relativism,
and thus must respect the views of all cultures with regard to
their systems of moral beliefs, can it condemn, in a logically
consistent manner, Culture B’s actions as immoral?

</p>

<p>
An essential feature of theory in general is
that it guides us in our investigations.
In science, theory provides us with some
general principles and structures to analyze
our data.
The purpose of ethical theory, like scientific
theory, is to provide a framework for
analyzing issues.
Ideally, a good theory should be coherent,
consistent, comprehensive, and systematic.

<p>
Ethical theories can help us to avoid inconsistent reasoning in our thinking about moral issues and moral dilemmas.
Recall again the runaway trolley scenario, but now imagine a variation of it in which victims of the trolley accident are taken to the hospital and only limited resources are available to the accident victims.
Which moral principle would you use in deciding who receives medical assistance and who does not?
Can you also apply that principal consistently across similar cases?
</p>

Imagine that as a result of the accident, The people are rushed to the hospital.
Each patient, whose condition is “critical,” is in need of a vital human organ to live, and there is not sufficient time to get these organs from a transplant donor bank located outside the hospital.
Also, the hospital happens to be under stated with surgeons at the time the accident victims are admiEed to the emergency ward.
So a medical physician (Dr. Smith) on duty at the hospital, who is administering a post-surgery physical exam to a patient in one room, is suddenly called into the emergency room.
Dr. Smith determines that one patient needs a heart, and another a kidney; a third patient needs a liver; a fourth,a pancreas; a pair of lungs.
Smith also determines that unless the victims receive the organ transplants immediately, each will die.
Then it suddenly occurs to Dr. Smith that the hospital patient on whom he had been conducting the physical exam is in excellent health.
If the healthy patient’s organs were removed and immediately given to each accident victim, all would live .
Of course, the healthy patient would die as a result.
But the net erect would be that four more humans would live.
What should Smith do in this case?
What would you do if you were in the doctor’s shoes?

<p>
The primary goal of a moral system is to produce desirable consequences or outcomes for its members.
The consequences (i.e., the ends achieved) of actions and policies that provide the ultimate standard against which moral decisions must be evaluated.
So if choosing between acts A or B, the morally correct action will be the one that produces the most desirable outcome.
In determining the best outcome, we can ask the question, whose outcome?

</p>

<p>
A policy is under consideration in a legislative body in the nation of Newmerica, where 1% of the population would be forced to work as slaves in a manufacturing facility to produce computer chips.
</p>

<p>
Proponents of this policy argue that, if enacted into law, it would result in lower prices for electronic devices for consumers in Newmerica.
They argue that it would also likely result in more overall happiness for the nation’s citizens because the remaining 99% of the population, who are not enslaved, would be able to purchase electronic devices and other computer-based products at a much lower price.
Hence, 99% of Newmerica’s population benefit at the expense of the remaining 1%.
</p>

<p>
This policy clearly seems consistent with the principle of producing the greatest good for the greatest number of Newmerica’s population, but should it be enacted into law?

</p>

<p>
Critics reject the emphasis on the consequence of individual acts.
In our day-to-day activities, we tend not to deliberate on each individual action as if that action were unique.
Instead, we are inclined to deliberate on the basis of certain principles or general rules that guide our behavior.  
</p>

<p>
Each time that you enter a store, do you ask
yourself the following question: “Shall I steal
item X in at this particular time?"
Or, have you already formulated certain
general principles that guide your individual
actions, such as a principle to the effect: "It is
never morally permissible to steal."

<p>
Some utilitarians argue that it is the
consequences that result from following rules
or principles, not the consequences of
individual acts, that are important.
According to rule utilitarianism:
</p>

<p>
An act, X, is morally permissible if the
consequences of following the general rule (Y),
of which act X is an instance, would bring about
the greatest good for the greatest number.

Utilitarian theory:
</p>

<p>
morality is ultimately tied to happiness or
pleasure;
morality can ultimately be determined by
consequences (of either acts or policies).
</p>

<p>
Critics of utilitarianism ague that morality can
be grounded neither in consequences nor in
happiness.
