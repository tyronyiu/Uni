<p>
Imagine that you are driving a trolley and that all of a sudden you realize that the trolley’s brake system has failed.
</p>

<p>
Further imagine that approximately 80 meters ahead of you on the trolley track (a short distance from the trolley’s staHon) five crew men are working on a secHon of the track on which your trolley is traveling.
</p>

<p>
You realize that you cannot stop the trolley and that you will probably not be able to prevent the deaths of the five workers.
</p>

<p>
But then you suddenly realize that you could “throw a switch” that would cause the trolley to go on to a different track.
</p>

<p>
You also happen to noHce that one person is working on that track.
</p>

<p>
You then realize that if you do nothing, five people will likely die, where as if you engage the switch to change tracks, only one person would likely die 
</p>

<p>
-- What would you do in this situaton? 
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Consider a variaton of this dilemma, which also involves a runaway trolley, but this Hme you are a spectator.
</p>

<p>
Imagine that you are standing on a bridge overlooking the track on which a runaway trolley is traveling.
</p>

<p>
You observe that the trolley is heading for the staHon where there are many people gathered outside.
</p>

<p>
Standing next to you on the bridge is a very large and obese person (weighing approximately 500 pounds), who is leaning forward over the rail of the bridge to view the runaway trolley.
</p>

<p>
You realize that if you gently pushed the obese person forward as the trolley approaches, he would fall off the bridge and land in front of the trolley; the impact would be sufficient to stop the trolley.
</p>

<p>
Thus you could save the lives of many people who otherwise would die.
</p>

<p>
Would you be willing to push the obese person off the bridge?
</p>

<p>
-- If not, why not? What has changed in the two scenarios? 
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Would you sacrifice one person to save five? - <em>Eleanor Nelsen</em>

<span id="The Runaway Trolley: A Classic Moral Dilemma-What is Morality"></span><strong id="What is Morality">What is Morality</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Morality can be defined as a system of rules for guiding human conduct, and principles for evaluating those rules.

<li>
Two points are worth noting in this:

<ul>
<li>
morality is a system;

<li>
it is a system comprised of moral rules and principles.

</ul>
<li>
Moral rules can be understood as "rules of conduct," which are very similar to "policies."

</ul>
   
<p>
<span id="The Runaway Trolley: A Classic Moral Dilemma-Directives"></span><strong id="Directives">Directives</strong>
</p>
   
<p>
Directives are rules (of conduct) that guide our actions, and thus direct us to behave in certain ways.
</p>

<p>
Rules such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
"Do not steal"

<li>
"Do not harm others"

</ul>

<p>
Are examples of rules of conduct that direct us in our individual moral choices at the "microethical" level (i.e., the level of individual behavior).
</p>

<p>
<span id="The Runaway Trolley: A Classic Moral Dilemma-Social Policies"></span><strong id="Social Policies">Social Policies</strong>
</p>

<p>
Some rules of conduct guide our actions at the "macro-ethical" level by helping us frame social policies.
</p>

<p>
Rules such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
“Proprietary software should not be copied“

<li>
“Software that can be used to invade the privacy of users should not be developed"

</ul>

<p>
Are both examples of rules of conduct that arise out
of our social policies.
</p>

<p>
Notice the correlation between directives and
social policies (e.g., rules involving stealing).
</p>
 
<p>
<span id="The Runaway Trolley: A Classic Moral Dilemma-Principles"></span><strong id="Principles">Principles</strong> 
</p>

<p>
The rules of conduct in a moral system are evaluated by way of standards called principles.
</p>

<p>
For example, the principle of "social utility“ (i.e., promoting the greatest good for the greatest number) can be used to evaluate a social policy such as “Proprietary software should not be copied without permission." 
</p>

<p>
A policy, X, could be justified (on utilitarian grounds) by showing that following Policy X (i.e., not allowing the unauthorized copying of software) would produce more overall social utility (greater good for society).

<span id="The Runaway Trolley: A Classic Moral Dilemma-Bernard Gert’s Scheme of a Moral"></span><strong id="Bernard Gert’s Scheme of a Moral">Bernard Gert’s Scheme of a Moral</strong>
</p>

<p>
According to Bernard Gert (2005), morality is a system that is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
like a game, but more like an informal game (e.g. a game of cards)

<li>
public (open and accessible to all)

<li>
rational (open to reason)

<li>
impartial (as illustrated in Gert’s “blindfold of justice”).

</ul>
