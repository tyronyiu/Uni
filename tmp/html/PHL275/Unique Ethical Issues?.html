<p>
Review the Meghan Meier “cyberbullying”incident (Scenario 1-1 in the textbook). 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Is there anything new or unique, from an ethical point of view, about the ethical issues that emerge in this scenario? 

<li>
On the one hand, Meier was bullied in ways that were not possible in the pre-Internet era. nBut are any new or any unique ethical issues generated in this scenario? 

</ul>

<p>
Megan Meier, a 13-year-old resident of Dardenne Prairie, Missouri, had an account on MySpace where she received a “friend” request from a user named Josh Evans.
Evans, who claimed to be a 16-year-old boy, told Meier that he lived near her and was being home-schooled by his parents.
At first, Evans sent flaIering e-mails to Meier, which also suggested that he might be romanJcally interested in her.
Soon, however, Evans’s remarks turned from compliments to insults, and Evans informed Meier that he was no longer sure that he wanted to be friends with her because he heard that she “wasn’t very nice to her friends.
Next, Meier noJced that some highly derogatory posts about her—e.g., “Megan Meier is a slut” and “Megan Meier is fat”—began to appear on MySpace.  Meier, who was reported to have suffered from low self-esteem and depression, became increasingly distressed by the online harassment (cyberbullying) being directed at her—i.e., from both the insulJng MySpace posJngs and hurSul e-mail messages she conJnued to receive from Evans. On October 17, 2006, Meier decided to end her life by hanging herself in her bedroom. An invesJgaJon of this incident, following Meier’s death, revealed that Josh Evans was not a teenage boy; she was Lori Drew, the 49-year-old mother of a former friend of Meier’

Consider Scenario 1-2 (in the textbook), involving PhoneDog and the Twitter account.
A number of ethical issues also arise,  especially concerns involving intellectual property rights and ownership of information. 
But are any of the ethical issues affecting this scenario unique ethical issues? nOr, are they all simply variations of traditional ethical issues? 
</p>

<p>
Noah Kravitz was employed by PhoneDog Media, a mobile phone company, for nearly four years. PhoneDog had two divisions: an e-commerce site (phonedog.com) that sold mobile phones, and a blog that enabled customers to interact with the company.
Kravitz created a blog on TwiIer (called Phonedog_Noah) while employed at PhoneDog, and his blog aIracted 17,000 followers by the Jme he lea the company in October 2010. However, Kravitz informed PhoneDog that he wanted to keep his TwiIer blog, with all of his followers; in return, Kravitz agreed that he would sJll “tweet” occasionally on behalf of his former company, under a new (TwiIer) “handle,” or account name, NoahKravitz.  •IniJally, PhoneDog seemed to have no problem with this arrangement. In July 2011, however, PhoneDog sued Kravitz, arguing that his list of TwiIer followers was, in fact, a company list. PhoneDog also argued that it had invested a substanJal amount of money in growing its customer list, which it considered to bethe property of PhoneDog Media.  •The company (as of early 2012) is seeking \(340,000 in damages—the amount that PhoneDog esJmated it had lost based on 17,000 customers at \)2.50 per customer over an eight-month period (following Kravitz’sdeparture from the company).

<ul>
<li>
Those who defend the Uniqueness thesis tend to overstate the effect that cybertechnology has on ethics per se. 

<li>
Maner (2004) correctly points out that computers are uniquely fast, uniquely, etc.

Their argument is based on a logical fallacy: Premise. Cybertechnology has some unique technological features. 

<li>
Premise Cybertechnology generates some ethical issues. Conclusion. (At least some of the) Ethical issues generated by cybertechnology must be unique

Traditionalists correctly point out that no new  ethical issues have been introduced by computers. 

<li>
Uniqueness proponents are correct in that cybertechnology has complicated our analysis of traditional ethical issues. 

<li>
Analyzing the issues involved in this debate, it is useful to distinguish between any:  unique technological features; (alleged) unique ethical issues.
