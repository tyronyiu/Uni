<p>
Measure any proposed agreement against this standard.
It will protect you from accepting a very bad agreement and keep you from rejecting an agreement that is in your interest.
</p>

<p>
List all alternatives and select the preferred one. 
</p>

<p>
Example alternatives of a BATNA analysis:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Sell for price I want

<li>
not sell

<li>
rent out

<li>
demolish &amp; build new

<li>
accept new price

</ul>

</p>

<p>
Alternatives should not be seen as an aggregate.
Negotiating without BATNA is like having your eyes closed.

</p>

<ol>
<li>
Invent a list of actions you might take if no agreement is reached,

<li>
Improve the ideas with the most potential and convert them into practical alternatives.

<li>
Tentatively select the best alternative.

</ol>

<p>
<em>Developing your BATNA thus not only enables you to determinate what is a minimally acceptable agreement. It will probably raise that minimum.</em> - Getting to Yes, R. Fisher &amp; W. Ury
