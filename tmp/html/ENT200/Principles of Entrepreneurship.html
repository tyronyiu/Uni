rent 500 bucks, 300 bucks into new gf. 200 bucks remaining.
thus the non-traditional competitor pressures your purchasing power and maybe shifting the interest.

<em>Market offerings</em> are some combinations of products, services, information or experiences offered to a makret to satisfy a need or want.
</p>

<p>
<em>Maket myopia</em> is focusing only on existing wants and losing sight of underlying consumer needs.

Customer value and satisfacrion expectations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Marketers set the right level of expectations which are nor too high or to low

<li>
Customers feel Value and satisfaction 

</ul>

<p>
<span id="Principles of Entrepreneurship-Mon Sep 17 16:03:29 BST 2018-Cost of acquiring a customer"></span><strong id="Cost of acquiring a customer">Cost of acquiring a customer</strong> - Basically, the CAC can be calculated by simply dividing all the costs spent on acquiring more customers (marketing expenses) by the number of customers acquired in the period the money was spent.
For example, if a company spent 100 on marketing in a year and acquired 100 customers in the same year, their CAC is 1.00.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Principles of Entrepreneurship-Mon Sep 17 16:03:29 BST 2018-lifetime value"></span><strong id="lifetime value">lifetime value</strong> - In marketing, customer lifetime value (CLV or often CLTV), lifetime customer value (LCV), or life-time value (LTV) is a prediction of the net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer.  
The lifetime value of e.g. whatsapp with half a billion customers is around 60 per customer.
</p>

<p>
Thus, a great LTV monetisation should be coupled with a low cost of acquiring a customer.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Focus comes from cleary understanding the value of your idea. 
</p>

<p>
A <em>one-to-two sentence statement</em> describes that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
What your product/service is

<li>
Who your customers are

<li>
Why its valuable to these customers

</ul>
   
<p>
"Winners is a department store that offers fashion conscious customers the latest brand names for up to 60% off."   
</p>

</p>

<p>
The value proposition template above would benefit from an additional section on where the benefit and value lies. (Why the product has a value)
