<ol>
<li>
Restless technological and social change. Result of capitalisms inherent dynamism.

<li>
Economic volatility. Capitalist dynamism is ‘manic’.

<li>
Deepening connections (‘globalisation’). The capitalist process is geographically promiscuous.

<li>
Unevenness. The world is not flat. It is unequal with chronic imbalances.

<li>
Insecurity. Disruption of lives due to capitalisms ‘creative destruction’. Causing political ‘blowback’.

<li>
Politics and Nation States were, and are still, important. Geopolitics persists....power matters.

<span id="Business and the world economy-Key Characteristics of the modern Economy-Dynamism"></span><strong id="Dynamism">Dynamism</strong>, Technological and social change raises the overall state. E.g. Innovation can make processes more efficient.
Table 3.9 illustrates total government expenditrure as per cent of GDP, showing the rise of state.
The technological dynamism is fueled by capitalism. Competition doesnt always need to create efficiency (e.g. having to advertise wont make the product better) Whenthe iPhone came out, it changed everything in the phone industry and made nokia obsolete. Also the advancement in technological progress fuels the overall dynamism of technology.

<span id="Business and the world economy-Key Characteristics of the modern Economy-Globalisation"></span><strong id="Globalisation">Globalisation</strong>, as great as it is is already old today. The interconnectiveness also causes many problems. 
Capitalism is naturally a wonderer, spreading. Thus, globalisation is elementary to globalism. This becomes clearer, when considering the interconnectiveness of capitalism and globalism. Even with new growth centers like China, there is constant concentration. e.g. African countries are unlike china and do things differently, the concentration of success is on e.g. India. 
One place can be emerging really quickly and well while the next place stays in poverty. The gaps get bigger between the extremes.
London for example has been getting more crowded every day. One street dead like a desert, the next street like a pisshole.

All the capitalism, economic volatility is great as a thing (making people rich etc.), but rather creates <span id="Business and the world economy-Key Characteristics of the modern Economy-Insecurity"></span><strong id="Insecurity">Insecurity</strong> (maybe working for uber in the future? - no ideas about stability of the future). There are great problems with stability in capitalism. 
Life isnt better with capitalism - Jobs satisfaction, status, quality of work isnt better nowadays for middle class people compared to e.g. ten years ago.

The big mighty Market of the world is freightening, nations and their states are the only force to withstand the power of the market. (Markets have swept away people lifes and made them insecure)

<span id="Business and the world economy-Key Characteristics of the modern Economy-Geopolitics"></span><strong id="Geopolitics">Geopolitics</strong> and the implications for the global market inherets serious problems threatening capitalism and globalisation. A big reason for geopolitics is the want for sovereigncy.

<span id="Business and the world economy-Key Characteristics of the modern Economy-Globalisation"></span><strong id="Globalisation">Globalisation</strong>
Many texts just focus on ‘globalisation’ as the only or the main feature/trend – that’s too narrow. ‘Globalisation’ is no longer the ‘latest hot issue’
</p>

<p>
<span id="Business and the world economy-Key Characteristics of the modern Economy-Blowback"></span><strong id="Blowback">Blowback</strong>
Recent political trends (Trump, Brexit. The ‘rise of populism’, ‘the return of geopolitics) is a backlash against several of my ‘key features’: Globalisation,Inequality,Volatility, Insecurity
It also proves globalisation is not irreversible; and politics still matters
1990’s rhetoric of a new liberal world order with all nations converging on American style capitalism and unified governance...is dead now. Geopolitical division and power plays, competition and alternative models of capitalism are the ‘news’ now.
A more contemporaneous summary of the present conjuncture  is not globalisation but a ‘crisis of liberal globalism’

Gold standard - You guarantee the conversion from your currency into gold. E.g. 35$ = 1 ounce of gold. If your gold supply decreases, it decreases the money supply. The gold standard can be abolished for further liquidity.
