If you start to collect the necessary information, it costs more and more until a law of diminishing returns is applied. 
E.g. paying an expensive firm to write reports on market research maybe doesn't make sense in circumstances. Tools like AI or similar don't add as much marginal benefit as expected or the staff to operate/optimise the tools isn't correctly trained or not present.

</p>

<p>
What data should influence your decision making process? - Divide between relevant and irrelevant information. Also beware of historical data to not influence present issues. 
</p>

<p>
In a business, only relevant cost should be considered for decision making purposes and irrelevant costs should be ignored.
</p>

<p>
Relevant costs should have three attributes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It should relate to the future

<li>
Cost should vary with the decision

<li>
Maximise wealth and relate to the objective of the business  

</ul>
   
<p>
If the cost is exactly the same in two scenarios of outcomes of decisions, the cost is irrelevant.
</p>

There is no additional cost for a business if e.g. employees are allocated to another task, as they are already being paid anyways.
E.G. A company asks for your technicians for a side project, they should be accounted for at least what they are being paid in order to not incur extra cost.
