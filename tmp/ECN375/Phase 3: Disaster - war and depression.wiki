*Phase 3: Disaster - war and depression*

*Defeat of the previous bout of globalization*

  * C19th had combined globalisation and competition for power and industrial advance.  
  * * Widely believed that successful capitalism was helped by empire-building and geopolitical power—even free trade Britain had (biggest) empire and world-straddling navy
  * Also many thought these things helped cushion against volatility and insecurity of world market
  * Power competition caused two World Wars...
  * But did also the world economy (by its depression, imbalances and strains, and intense competition) contribute?

*Between the wars*

  * Dislocation, imbalances, debt and ‘false’ boom of 1920’s
  * Failure to reconstruct and stabilise world money order or cooperation and institutions
  * Then financial crash on Wall Street 1929, and global banking meltdown
  * Then deep depression for much of the thirties
