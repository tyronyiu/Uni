*Phase 1: Becoming modern*

European states take lead
Practising mercantiliism (wealth plus power):
  * Monopolies (and monopoly trade)
  * Colonies
  * Export surplus

A struggle for power, dominance and subservience
We want an export surplus to have a greater inflow of money than outflow.

The _west_ drags _the rest_ into the nascent world economy. 
World divison of labour knitted by trade, not all of it nice.
_Triangular trade_, raw material and slave labour made the final product. 
Now the atlantic is seen as the centre of trade.
Goods are being sent from europe to the americas and slave trade with africa is high. 

Britain takes the lead. From Mercantilism came massive profits, yet britain re-invested in industry. 
Their approach was more capitalistic. (unlike spain or portugal)
They made not just _money from trade_ but from _money from production_. British aristocrats and merchants invested in industry and thus Britain turned into the first and most importantly industrialised country.
