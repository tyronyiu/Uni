*Phase 2: Industry*

Capitalism and industry - a new dynamism

Capital accumulation: Constant re-investment forced by competition creates permanent technological revolution. (steam, rail, telegraph, refrigeration) (1870 - 1913 GDP pa grew 2.1% exports up by 3.4%. Compared to 0.1%pa in 1700-1820.)

*Empire*
  * International politics (the struggle to dominate) - the globalisation caused unequal power.
  * Britain - world workshop and banker. Birth of libaral economics, gold standard.
  * Globalisation = integration (people, capital as well as goods) - people moved more freely than today. (Germans big leader in transportation industry)
  * Germany US and Japan keep and catch up with the British industry using protection
  * End of C19 - thre is rising protectionism and expanding state alongside increasing globalisation 

The British invented free trade, the answer of e.g. Germany is called protectionism. Protectionism was used as the catch-up function to Britains industry heads up.
