*Responses â€“ from economic crisis to war*

  * Rise of extreme nationalism (Facism)
  * Beggar-my-neighbor economic policy (protectionism, exchange rate manipulation, control of international flows)
  * Fasted recovery was by those prepared for wars - arms stimulated capitalism where nothing else could. Japan and Germany brought the world back together in the earlier part of the thirties. They did so by preparing for war. Imposing their will on other countries saved international trade.
  * Predatory war and closed blocs - war (for conquest by challengers - japan and germany) for openess and primacy.
  * Britain once champion of openness becomes imperial-protectionist in its weakness faced by depression and loss of competitive advantage.

Japan and Germany applied the same tactique, expand and swallow everything thats possible to oppose the british and american economies. Their actions brought them up close to the bigger world economies. 

Two rival lessons from the disaster:

  * Nationalism is to blame, international economic liberalism is the answer.
  * Unmanaged capitalism is to blame - must replace it (Marxism) or manage it (Keynesianism or Facism)
One of the only forces to withstand world market is extreme nationalism.
