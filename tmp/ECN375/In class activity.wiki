Germany
In germany the political and economic system is rather traditional and conservative. The place to do business follows safety first and similar traditional concepts. Thus, the german people in their economic view are traditional as well. They'd rather save their money under their bed mattres than give it to the bank or give it all to the bank. That shows how the german folk is often splitinto two ends of the spectrum. Their view on economics for the public is classical. Very interestingly, where you are in germany dictates a lot about the political and economical views the folk has about the system. The more rural, the more conservative. Germany's metropolitan cities like Hamburg, Berlin or Munich are rather neo-classical in their thinking and the diverse public in those cities allows further progression. Hamburg for example is a city with the most extreme tendency to neoliberalism, the people are younger and more diverse than in e.g. Munich, where the tendency for political view is on the right side of the spectrum, where as hamburg is left and capitalistic instead of liberal.
