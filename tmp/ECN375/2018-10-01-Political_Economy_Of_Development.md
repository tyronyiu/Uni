## Late developer mercantilism

**Mercantilism** - a common historical pattern for 'catch up' and 'late development'. Mercantilism can also be described as economic nationalism by recent developments.

Late developers strive to create capitalism, but also protecgt and promot industry against displacement threat of superior competitors.
Includes 19th Century Europe and US but even gree traders once were mercantilists.

**Herman Schwartz** says that Industrial leaders are a displacement threat to latecomers.
There are two strategies to deal with it, *Ricardian* strategy, supplying industrial leaders with primary produce instead of competing. *Kaldorian* strategy, grow to compete with leaders (needs state protection, and will get this, as these industries are where the money is.)
