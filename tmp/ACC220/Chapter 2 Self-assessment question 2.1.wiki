== Chapter 2 Self-assessment question 2.1 ==

*Material Requirements*
   
  * 3kg of Material M1
  * 2kg of Material P2
  * 1 bought-in component 
   
*Labour Requirements*   

  * skilled: 400 * 5h = 2,000hrs
  * semi-skilled: 400 * 5h = 2,000hrs

*General Manufacturing Cost*

*Material M1*
in use

Market price of 550

$400 * 200 = 80,000 (Revenue)$

$400 units * 3kg = 1,200kg$ 

option 1: $1,000 * 5.5 = 6,600$ and then $200* 5.5$

option 2: $1,200 * 5.5 = 6,600$

*Material P2*

$400 units * 2kg = 800kg$

selling: 1.5

net saving of substitution: $3.6 - 1.6 = 2$ 

$800 * 2 = 1,600$

*Part 678*

$400 units * 1 = 400$

$400 * 50 = 20,000$

*Skilled Employee*

The salary paid to already employed employees do not incur any additional cost. (14 pounds per hour)

Thus, $2,000 * 12 = 24,000$

*Semi-Skilled Employee*

$2,000 * 10 = 20,000$

*General Manufacturing Cost*

By undertaking the contract an additional cost of 3,200 is incurred.

$400 units * 4h = 1,600hrs$

$1,600 * 20 \pm 32,000$

*Total Relevant Cost:* 75,400
*Total Revenue:* 80,000

The project would thus make a profit of 4,600.
