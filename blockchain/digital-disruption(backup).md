Telco companies offer a centralised data exchange system (mobile data).
Every device talks to the relays owned by the Telco to exchange information to
another device, instead of directly connecting the devices themselves. 
If there were a distributed mesh network as an internet, powered by the people,
it wouldn't only be cheaper or sustainable in the long term but removes many
costs attached to current telco's. 
There are two choices, give the technology to the companies, making money in the
short term, or giving it to the people, who will put it to use sustainably.
