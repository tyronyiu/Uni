excerpt: "How a typical pain scenario may be encountered in every day life,
showing the need for the solution."

A typical scenario for the concept of utility provision using decentralised,
consensus driven Blockchain would be to imagine someone in a rural area such as
within the southern African countries.

Let us have a look at a specific country and imagine a typical day of someone
living there, experiencing the pain problems mentioned.

South Sudan has only 5.1% of its population enjoying access to electricity. It
has less than 1% of its roads being paved ones, and less than 1% of the
population have formal, Western-style housing as we would recognize it as well.
Such a want for facilities has been the result of 30 years of war and government
neglect. The government is now trying to attract foreign investors to conduct
their varied business ventures within South Sudan. Many of these will be for
power generation and distribution, transportation infrastructure, and property
development.

If we put ourselves into a south-Sudan inhabitant living in a rural area we
can start analysing the need for the realisation of the idea, based on the pain
that is induced by not having the idea realised on a daily basis.

Besides requiring energy access being crucial for many basic human needs, the
underserved populations represent a massive commercial opportunity for
sub-Saharan African utilities. Advances in distributed renewable energy
technologies have made utility providing units more affordable, faster to deploy
and more transparently/stable.

Considering the rates of individuals and communities living *under-the-grid* of
many sub-Saharan African countries, it seems like there is much potential for
the offering of a electricity providing utility service.

### Notes

- Description, high level map of scenario, hotspot within scenario (pain
  concentration), who are the actors in the hot-spot and what are the pain
  points?  How does that impact you and your role within the organisation? (e.g.
  an educated inhabitant of South Sudan is highly limited in the potential
  realisation available)

- What is it now? What does it need to be? Why does it need to be like that? ->
  because of all the pain (you even laid out yourself)

- Difference between a community being completely rural and being nearby a
  grid-connection, but not being connected. Is there one? Shouldn't the solution
  be applicable to both? -> Independence should be a driving factor.

- Pay-as-you-go systems provide much lower barrier to entry. They are fast and
  agile and have much shorter installation times. 

- The willingness to get involved with PAYG decentralised renewable energies is
  much higher than a grid connection due to the upfront cost and reliability.

- You can't measure kindness, but the impact kindness has upon someone in a particular scenario.

- Do I combine water+electricity (yeah!)
