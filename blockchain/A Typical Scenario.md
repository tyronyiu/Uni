excerpt: "How a typical pain scenario may be encountered in every day life,
showing the need for the solution."

A typical scenario for the concept of utility provision using decentralised,
consensus driven Blockchain would be to imagine someone in a rural area such as
within the southern African countries.

Let us have a look at a specific country and imagine a typical day of someone
living there, experiencing the pain problems mentioned.

South Sudan has only 5.1% of its population enjoying access to electricity. It
has less than 1% of its roads being paved ones, and less than 1% of the
population have formal, Western-style housing as we would recognize it as well.
Such a want for facilities has been the result of 30 years of war and government
neglect. The government is now trying to attract foreign investors to conduct
their varied business ventures within South Sudan. Many of these will be for
power generation and distribution, transportation infrastructure, and property
development.

Description, high level map of scenario, hotspot within scenario (pain
concentration), who are the actors in the hot-spot and what are the pain points?
How does that impact you and your role within the organisation? (e.g. an
educated inhabitant of South sudan is highly limited in the potential
realisation available)

What is it now? What does it need to be? Why does it need to be like that? ->
because of all the pain (you even laid out yourself)
