# Performance Management
- Goal-oriented process ensuring processes are in place to maximize productivity
  at employee, team, and organizational levels
- Close relationship between incentives and performance. 
- Dynamic, ongoing, continuous process
- Each part of the system is integrated and linked for continuous organizational
  effectiveness 

# Performance Appraisal
- Formal system of review and evaluation of individual or team task performance
- Often negative, disliked activity that seems to elude mastery 

## Uses of Performance Appraisal
- Human resource planning
- Recruitment and selection
- Training and development 
- Career planning and development
    - E.g. An over-performing employee may be considered to receive
      promotions/training/development for further value addition 
- Compensation programs
- Internal employee relations
- Assessment of employee potential

## The Performance Appraisal Process
![Performance Appraisal Process](https://i.ibb.co/vkmfXqv/Performance-appraisal-process.png)

What is expected needs to be communicated within the organisation, in order to
set global standards. These expectations should be defined in specific
performance appraisal goals prior, to then be communicated. The work examined
should receive appropriate appraisal. This is where problems may arise, thus the
feedback and discussion from/with employees is vital for optimising performance
appraisal process. An example of a problem arising could be expectations that
are set way too high by management or way too low, thus expectations set and
performance observed won't match. Employees may also find their compensation
inadequate and that may be supported fairly, thus the appraisal process may have
failures.

### Performance Criteria (Standards)
- Traits
- Behaviors
- Competencies
- Goal achievement
- Improvement potential

This relates to the specific objective setting process and performance
measurement process, of the above seen figure.

#### Traits
- Employee traits such as attitude, appearance, and initiative are basis for
  some evaluations 
- May be unrelated to job performance or be difficult to define 
- Certain traits may relate to job performance

These considerations should be made when examining work performed. 

##### Caution on Traits: Wade v. Mississippi Cooperative Extension Service
> In performance appraisal system, general characteristics such as "*leadership,
> public acceptance, attitude toward people, appearance and grooming, personal
> conduct, outlook on life, ethical habits, resourcefulness, capacity for
> growth, mental alertness, loyalty to organization* are susceptible to
> partiality and to the personal taste, whim, or fancy of the evaluator as well
> as patently subjective in form and obviously susceptible to completely
> subjective treatment by those conducting the appraisals" 

#### Behaviors 
- Organizations may evaluate employee’s task-related behavior or competencies
- Examples are leadership style, developing others, teamwork and cooperation, or
  customer service orientation
- If certain behaviors result in desired outcomes, there is merit in using them
  in evaluation process   

Relating to *"Traits"* above, behaviour analysis goes a longer way than
*"Trait"* analysis. Though, selection of information is required in either
processes/analyses.

#### Competencies 
- Broad range of knowledge, skills, traits, and behaviors 
- May be technical in nature, business oriented, or related to interpersonal
  skills
- Should be those that are closely associated with job success  

Competences required or adding value should be appraised, though selection again
is required, as e.g. speaking four languages in a domestic local company doesn't
add value necessarily.

#### Goal Achievement
- Use if organizations consider ends more important than means
- Should be within control of individual or team  
- Should be those results that lead to firm’s success

The personal goals should represent the goals of the organisational goals, this
alignment is similar to how the needs of the few should align with the needs of
the many. Setting goals correctly is important. Goals should be set adequately,
so that e.g. there isn't too much internal competition between employees. It has
to be considered that people should only be appraised for performance they are
in control of / responsible of. E.g. The professor not being able to do his job
because the IT infrastructure isn't working, than he shouldn't be blamed for
poor performance.

#### Improvement Potential 
- Many criteria used focus on past
- Cannot change past
- Should emphasize future

Quality over speed considered.

#### Responsibility for Appraisal
- Immediate supervisor
- Subordinates
- Peers and team members
- Self-appraisal
- Customer appraisal
- 360-degree feedback

Supervisors close to the individual considered for appraisal, should be
responsible for their performance appraisal measurement/process. How they
integrate in the organisation or the team is also important besides the
individual characteristics.

##### Immediate Supervisor 
- Traditionally most common choice 
- Usually in excellent position to observe employee’s job performance 
- Has responsibility for managing particular unit 

##### Subordinates 
- Our culture has viewed evaluation by subordinates negatively 
- Some firms find that evaluation of managers by subordinates is both feasible
  and needed 
- Issues:
    - Could be seen as a popularity contest
    - Possible reprisal against employees

##### Peers and Team Members 
- Work closely with evaluated employee and probably have undistorted perspective
  on typical performance
- Problems include reluctance of some people who work closely together,
  especially on teams, to criticize each other 

Authority can induce communicated between close peers, though the closeness
could also create barriers of truth due to emotional sensibilities.

##### Self-Appraisal 
- If employees understand their objectives and the criteria used for evaluation,
  they are in a good position to appraise own performance 
- Employee development is self-development 
- Self-appraisal may make employees more highly motivated 

##### Customer Appraisal 
- Customer behavior determines firm’s degree of success 
- Demonstrates commitment to customer
- Holds employees accountable
- Fosters change Customer Appraisal 
- Customer behavior determines firm’s degree of success 
- Demonstrates commitment to customer
- Holds employees accountable
- Fosters change

##### 360-Degree Feedback
- Input from multiple sources such as supervisors, subordinates, peers, and
  customers
- Shifting responsibility to multiple sources helps to reduce or eliminate
  common appraisal errors
- Process is more legally defensible

## The Appraisal Period
- Prepared at specific intervals
- Usually annually or semiannually
- Period may begin with employee’s date of hire
- All employees may be evaluated at same time

### Performance Appraisal Systems
- Trait systems
- Comparison systems
- Behavioral systems
- Results-based systems

#### Trait Systems
- Evaluate employees based on traits (for example):
    - Quality of work
    - Dependability
- Limitations (e.g., traits represent a predisposition for behavior, but not behavior itself)

![Trait-Oriented Performance Appraisal](https://i.ibb.co/wwr6LvM/trait-oriented-appraisal.png)

#### Comparison Systems
- Evaluate an employee’s performance against that of another
- Employees ranked from the best performer to the poorest performer
- Supervisors judge overall performance or specific ones (e.g., timeliness)

##### Paired Comparison
- Variation of ranking method
- Compares performance of each employee with every other employee in group

![Paired Compared Systems](https://i.ibb.co/fdrFt6Y/paired-compared-systems.png)

##### Forced Distribution
- Rater assigns individual in work group to limited number of categories
- Assumes all groups of employees have same distribution
- Proponents of forced distribution believe:
    - They facilitate budgeting
    - They guard against weak managers who are too timid to get rid of poor
      performers 
- Require managers to be honest with workers about how they are doing 
- Also called a rank-and-yank system 
- Unpopular with many managers 
- May damage morale and generate mistrust of leadership 
- Rankings may be way for companies to easily rationalize firings

#### Behavioral Systems
- Rates extent to which employees display successful job performance behaviors
- When correctly constructed, behavioral systems are relatively free of rater errors
- Three types:
    - Critical Incident Technique (CIT)
    - Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales (BARS)
    - Behavioral Observation Scale (BOS)

##### Critical Incident Technique (CIT)
![Critical Incidence technique](https://i.ibb.co/yyGCTdW/critical-incidence-technique.png)

##### Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales (BARS)
- Combines traditional rating scales and critical incidents methods
- Job behaviors derived from critical incidents described more objectively

![](https://i.ibb.co/FwRQc4V/BARS.png)

##### Behavioral Observation Scales (BOS
- Similar to BARS in its development
- Compared to BARS, BOS focuses exclusively on positive performance behaviors
- Appropriate for jobs that require observable behaviors
- Requires observation of job behaviors on a regular basis

#### Results-Based Systems
- Focuses on measurable outcomes such as sales, accident rates, and productivity
- Selection of results depends on:
- Relevance of results toward strategic goals
- Reliability with which results can be measured
- Validity of performance measure

### Management by Objectives
- Supervisors and employees decide on performance objectives
- They decide whether objectives are tied to the company’s strategic goals
- Progress is reviewed and decisions such as objective revision are made
- A concern is a “results at any cost” mentality

### Work Standards
- Compares performance to predetermined standard
- Standards: Normal output of average worker operating at normal pace
- Time study and work sampling used
- Workers need to know how standards were set

![Work standards](https://i.ibb.co/pRpf0Rd/work-standards.png)

### Problems in Performance Appraisal
- Appraiser discomfort
- Subjectivity
    - Bias errors
    - Contrast errors
    - Errors of central tendency
    - Errors of leniency or strictness
- Employee anxiety

#### Appraiser Discomfort
- Performance appraisal process cuts into manager’s time
- Experience can be unpleasant when employee has not performed well

#### Lack of Objectivity 
- Factors such as attitude, appearance, and personality are difficult to measure 
- Factors may have little to do with employee’s job performance
- May place evaluator and company in untenable positions  

#### Bias Errors
- First-impression effect
- Halo effect (positive halo)
- Horn effect (negative halo)
- Similar-to-me effect
- Illegal discriminatory bias

#### Contrast Errors
- Supervisors make contrast errors when they compare an employee with other
  employees rather than to specific, explicit standards
- Some comparisons qualify as errors because other employees are required to
  perform only at minimum acceptable standards
- Employees performing at minimally acceptable levels should receive
  satisfactory ratings, even if every other employee doing the job is performing
  at outstanding levels

#### Central Tendency 
- Error occurs when employees are incorrectly rated near average or middle of
  the rating scale
- May be encouraged by some rating scale systems requiring evaluator to justify
  extremely high or extremely low ratings  

#### Leniency/Strictness 
- Leniency: Giving undeserved high ratings
- Strictness: Being unduly critical of employee’s work performance 
- Worst situation is when firm has both lenient and strict managers and does
  nothing to level inequities 

#### Employee Anxiety 
- Evaluation process may create anxiety for appraised employee 
- Opportunities for promotion, better work assignments, and increased
  compensation may hinge on results

## Characteristics of Effective Appraisal System
- Job-related criteria
- Performance expectations
- Standardization
- Trained appraisers
- Continuous open communication
- Performance reviews
- Due process

### Job-Related Criteria 
- Most basic criterion needed in employee performance appraisals 
- Uniform Guidelines and court decisions are clear on this point 

### Performance Expectations 
- Managers and subordinates must agree on performance expectations in advance of
  appraisal period 
- If employees clearly understand expectations, they can evaluate their own
  performance and make timely adjustments 

### Standardization 
Firms should use same evaluation instrument for all employees in the same job
category who work for the same supervisor 

### Trained Appraisers 
- Seldom receive training on how to conduct effective evaluations 
- Training should be ongoing
- Includes how to rate employees and how to conduct appraisal interviews 

### Continuous Open Communication 
- Employees need to know how well they are performing 
- Good appraisal system provides highly desired feedback on continuing basis 
- Should be few surprises in performance review 

### Conduct Performance Reviews 
- Special time should be set for formal discussion of employee’s performance 
- Withholding appraisal results is absurd
- Performance review allows employees to detect any errors or omissions in appraisal
- Employee may simply disagree with  evaluation and want to challenge it  

### Due Process
- Provides employees opportunity to appeal appraisal results 
- Must have procedure for pursuing grievances and having them addressed objectively

## Legal Implications
- Employee lawsuits may result from negative evaluations
- Unlikely that any appraisal system will be immune to legal challenge 

### Appraisal Interview
- Achilles heel of entire evaluation process 
- Scheduling interview
- Interview structure
- Use of praise and criticism
- Employee’s role
- Concluding interview

### Scheduling the Interview
- Employees typically know when their interview should take place
- Anxiety tends to increase if their supervisor delays the meeting

### Interview Structure
- Discuss employee’s performance 
- Assist employee in setting goals and personal development plans for next appraisal period 
- Suggesting means for achieving established goals, including support from manager and firm 

### Conducting Separate Interviews 
- Conduct separate interviews for discussing:
    - Employee performance and development
    - Pay 
- When pay emerges in interview, it tends to dominate conversation 
- Performance improvement then takes a back seat

### Use of Praise and Criticism 
- Praise is appropriate when warranted 
- Criticism, even if warranted, is especially difficult to give 
- “Constructive” criticism is often not perceived that way

### Employee’s Role 
- Should go through diary or files and make notes of all projects, regardless of their success
- Information should be on appraising manager’s desk well before review 

### Concluding the Interview 
- Ideally, employees will leave interview with positive feelings about management, company, job, and themselves 
- Cannot change past behavior; future performance is another matter
- Interview should end with specific and mutually agreed-upon plans for employee’s development  

### Performance Appraisal and a Country’s Culture 
- Special problems when translated into different cultural environments 
- Chinese managers often have different idea about what performance is than do Western managers
- Culture also plays significant role in  success and failure of performance appraisal systems in the Middle East
