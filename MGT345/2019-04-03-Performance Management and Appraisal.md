## Performance Management
- Goal-oriented process ensuring processes are in place to maximize productivity
  at employee, team, and organizational levels
- Close relationship between incentives and performance. 
- Dynamic, ongoing, continuous process
- Each part of the system is integrated and linked for continuous organizational
  effectiveness 

## Performance Appraisal
- Formal system of review and evaluation of individual or team task performance
- Often negative, disliked activity that seems to elude mastery 

## Uses of Performance Appraisal
- Human resource planning
- Recruitment and selection
- Training and development 
- Career planning and development
    - E.g. An over-performing employee may be considered to receive
      promotions/training/development for further value addition 
- Compensation programs
- Internal employee relations
- Assessment of employee potential

## The Performance Appraisal Process
![Performance Appraisal Process](https://i.ibb.co/vkmfXqv/Performance-appraisal-process.png)

What is expected needs to be communicated within the organisation, in order to
set global standards. These expectations should be defined in specific
performance appraisal goals prior, to then be communicated. The work examined
should receive appropriate appraisal. This is where problems may arise, thus the
feedback and discussion from/with employees is vital for optimising performance
appraisal process. An example of a problem arising could be expectations that
are set way too high by management or way too low, thus expectations set and
performance observed won't match. Employees may also find their compensation
inadequate and that may be supported fairly, thus the appraisal process may have
failures.

## Establish Performance Criteria (Standards)
- Traits
- Behaviors
- Competencies
- Goal achievement
- Improvement potential

This relates to the specific objective setting process and performance
measurement process, of the above seen figure.

### Traits
- Employee traits such as attitude, appearance, and initiative are basis for
  some evaluations 
- May be unrelated to job performance or be difficult to define 
- Certain traits may relate to job performance

These considerations should be made when examining work performed. 

### Caution on Traits: Wade v. Mississippi Cooperative Extension Service
> In performance appraisal system, general characteristics such as "*leadership,
> public acceptance, attitude toward people, appearance and grooming, personal
> conduct, outlook on life, ethical habits, resourcefulness, capacity for
> growth, mental alertness, loyalty to organization* are susceptible to
> partiality and to the personal taste, whim, or fancy of the evaluator as well
> as patently subjective in form and obviously susceptible to completely
> subjective treatment by those conducting the appraisals" 

### Behaviors 
- Organizations may evaluate employee’s task-related behavior or competencies
- Examples are leadership style, developing others, teamwork and cooperation, or
  customer service orientation
- If certain behaviors result in desired outcomes, there is merit in using them
  in evaluation process   

Relating to *"Traits"* above, behaviour analysis goes a longer way than
*"Trait"* analysis. Though, selection of information is required in either
processes/analyses.

### Competencies 
- Broad range of knowledge, skills, traits, and behaviors 
- May be technical in nature, business oriented, or related to interpersonal
  skills
- Should be those that are closely associated with job success  

Competences required or adding value should be appraised, though selection again
is required, as e.g. speaking four languages in a domestic local company doesn't
add value necessarily.

### Goal Achievement
- Use if organizations consider ends more important than means
- Should be within control of individual or team  
- Should be those results that lead to firm’s success

The personal goals should represent the goals of the organisational goals, this
alignment is similar to how the needs of the few should align with the needs of
the many. Setting goals correctly is important. Goals should be set adequately,
so that e.g. there isn't too much internal competition between employees. It has
to be considered that people should only be appraised for performance they are
in control of / responsible of. E.g. The professor not being able to do his job
because the IT infrastructure isn't working, than he shouldn't be blamed for
poor performance.

### Improvement Potential 
- Many criteria used focus on past
- Cannot change past
- Should emphasize future

Quality over speed considered.

## Responsibility for Appraisal
- Immediate supervisor
- Subordinates
- Peers and team members
- Self-appraisal
- Customer appraisal
- 360-degree feedback

Supervisors close to the individual considered for appraisal, should be
responsible for their performance appraisal measurement/process. How they
integrate in the organisation or the team is also important besides the
individual characteristics.

### Immediate Supervisor 
- Traditionally most common choice 
- Usually in excellent position to observe employee’s job performance 
- Has responsibility for managing particular unit 

### Subordinates 
- Our culture has viewed evaluation by subordinates negatively 
- Some firms find that evaluation of managers by subordinates is both feasible
  and needed 
- Issues:
    - Could be seen as a popularity contest
    - Possible reprisal against employees

### Peers and Team Members 
- Work closely with evaluated employee and probably have undistorted perspective
  on typical performance
- Problems include reluctance of some people who work closely together,
  especially on teams, to criticize each other 

Authority can induce communicated between close peers, though the closeness
could also create barriers of truth due to emotional sensibilities.

### Self-Appraisal 
- If employees understand their objectives and the criteria used for evaluation,
  they are in a good position to appraise own performance 
- Employee development is self-development 
- Self-appraisal may make employees more highly motivated 

### Customer Appraisal 
- Customer behavior determines firm’s degree of success 
- Demonstrates commitment to customer
- Holds employees accountable
- Fosters change Customer Appraisal 
- Customer behavior determines firm’s degree of success 
- Demonstrates commitment to customer
- Holds employees accountable
- Fosters change

### 360-Degree Feedback
- Input from multiple sources such as supervisors, subordinates, peers, and
  customers
- Shifting responsibility to multiple sources helps to reduce or eliminate
  common appraisal errors
- Process is more legally defensible

## The Appraisal Period
- Prepared at specific intervals
- Usually annually or semiannually
- Period may begin with employee’s date of hire
- All employees may be evaluated at same time
