*take-away from class 1*

: Managing Human resources tends to increase the competitive advantage of the
strengths of the firm. 

HR originated Competitive advantage that cannot be easily copied, thus being
more intrinsic per entity. Service industries can benefit from this more than
e.g. product industries due to the skills that cause competitive advantage are
of the individuals.

HRM functions are interrelated to affect another. E.g. *pay for performance
compensation* plan depends upon reliable and valid performance appraisal
practices. -> Cannot assign pay based upon performance if performance cannot be
measured.

### How does poor staffing affect human resource development?

Poor staffing causes the wrong people for the job or not the best people.
Resulting effects upon human resource development, is that e.g. training or
development will significantly be reduced in effectiveness/efficiency. This
poorly selected staff could also be overqualified. Thus, training and
developement tend to become even less effective, as staff might be on different
levels of skillsets / extend of knowledge of subject of training. 

Bad staffing could result in Career Development decreasing in effectiveness,
because the staff's values may not align with the firm's, Career objectives will
differ and close integration will be hard.

### Your Company is one of the fastest growing companies - How does it affect
HR?

- Your Company is one of the *Fortune 100* companies
- Your Company is one of the greatest places to work
- Your comapny is one of the worst companies to work for

The fast growing, leads to the HR department needing to grow with the
organisation proportionally. How much people want to work for the firm also
affects HR. *Needing to market the empty work slots or having to work through
mountains of applications, makes staffing hard.* Staffing will be decreased in
effectiveness, but ultimately, depending on the extend of the problem, sectors
like performance management will be affected. E.g. many new workers, no rapid
growth strategy will cause performance management to become ineffective and
obviously affect compensation.

### HR Professionals

Act in advisory or staff capacity, though used to be responsible for each of the
six HR functions. HR departments tend to become smaller, and become closer
integrated with other managers.

### Line Managers

Directly oversee accomplishments of organisations primary objectives.
Performing some duties of HR' historic functions, like training.

## Strategic Planning Process

1. Determination of the organisation mission
    - Determining principles that will guide effort
2. Assessment of the organisation and its environment
    - SWOT for internal/external analysis
3. Setting of specific objectives or direction
4. Determination of strategies to accomplish those objectives

![The strategic planning / implementing process](https://i.ibb.co/XYN0kYt/strategic-planning-implementing-process.png)

### Strategy Setting

Frameworks that can be used, are *SWOT analysis, PESTEL analysis, The Boston
Consulting Group Matrix and Porter's Five Forces.* What are we in management
attempting to do for whom? Should we maximise profit for dividends or higher
share prices? Mostly, these missions are very generic, for Coca Cola it is
*refreshing the world*. Pivots can be a reason for changing a mission, thus a
broader mission will incur less changes to be made. Strategy setting has two
options: *Lowest Cost strategy*, which focuses on gaining competitive advantage
by being the lowest cost producer of a product within the market. Lowest cost
strategies require aggressive construction of efficient-scale facilities and
vigorous pursuit of cost minimisation in such areas as operations, marketing or
HR. The second strategic option is *differentiation strategies*, which focus on
developing products that are unique from those of their competitors.
Differentiation strategy can make many forms include design, technology,
costumer service or price.

### Strategy Implementation 

- Leadership 
- Organizational Structure 
- Information and Control Systems 
- Technology 
- Human Resources 

## Human Resource Planning

We need to match the internal and external supply of candidates with job
openings anticipated in the organisation over a specific time period. The
important figure below shows the complete human resource planning process in
overview. HR needs to plan based on what the overall strategy is as well as
before planning, an overview of what the circumstances are in the moment has to
be created using HR, this is indicated by the *both sided arrow*. It has to be
defined what skills, experience, number of employees, what sectors, where are
needed when. *Forecasting* also includes considering what is already within the
organisation (Forecasting Human Resource Availability), which helps identifying
what is needed (Forecasting Human Resource Requirements). Thus, the first level
(blue) is comparing what we have to what we need. The second level decides what
needs to be done in three different scenarios. Where there is a *surplus of
labour*, hiring should be restricted, hours reduced and depending on gravity,
downsizing mechanism such as laying staff off. Where there is a *shortage of
labour*, the recruitment mechanism leads to the selection of new labour.

## Techniques for Forecasting Human Resource Requirements 

- Relationship between volume of sales and number of workers required 

### Zero-based Forecast

Uses current level of staffing as starting point for determining future staffing
needs. It is essentially the same as zero based budgeting. Key is a thorough
analysis of human resource need.

### Bottom-up Forecast

Each level of organisation, starting with lowest, forecasts its requirements to
provide aggregate of employment needs. 

![The Relationship of Sales Volume to Number of Employees](https://ibb.co/NrqSnkw"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/3vbzY8t/Sales-Volume-No-of-employees.png)

### Availability Forecast

Whether a firm will be able to secure employees with necessary skills. Sources
from which to obtain employees. These source can be higher higher education.
Proactive engagement can be successful when considering *Dyson* and their
established university, that adopts their trained students into the company for
hire.

### Shortage of Workers Forecasted

When there is a shortage in labour forecasted innovative recruiting,
compensation incentives, training programs and modified selection standards
should be used to tackle the downfall. People could be hired via challenges,
such as *The Hult Price*. Labour could be kept within using compensation
incentives. Innovative recruiting includes exclusive traditional recruitment. An
example could be an App like *Linkedin*.

### Surplus of Employees

When a comparison of requirements and availability indicates a worker surplus
will result, most companies look to alternatives to layoffs, but downsizing may
ultimately be required. Instead of Layoffs, strategies such as: Restricted
hiring policy, Early retirement, Encouraging workers to use vacation
time, Swapping employees, Moving employees from full-time to 30 hours a week
without reducing health benefits, Job-sharing arrangements, Reduce the workweek
, Offer an unpaid holiday option, Sabbaticals for selected employees, could be
used.
