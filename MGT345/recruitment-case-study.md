## HRM Incident 1: A Problem Ad? 

Dorothy Bryant was the new recruiting supervisor for International Manufacturing
Company in Salt Lake City, Utah. One of Dorothy’s first assignments was to
recruit two software design engineers for International. Design engineers are
hard to recruit because of the difficulty of their training and the high demand
for them. After considering various recruitment alternatives, Dorothy placed the
following ad in a local newspaper with a circulation in excess of 1,000,000:

```

    EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITYFOR SOFTWARE DESIGN ENGINEERS

2 positions available for engineers desiring career in growth industry.Prefer
recent college graduates with good appearance.Good credit ratingApply Today!
Send your résumé,inconfidence, to: D. A. BryantInternational Manufacturing Co.,
P.O. Box 1515Salt Lake City, UT  84115    

```

More than 300 applications arrived in the first week, and Dorothy was elated.
When she reviewed the applicants, however, it appeared that few people possessed
the desired qualifications for the job.


### QUESTIONS

1. Dorothy overlooked some of the proper recruiting practices, which resulted in
   an excessive number of unqualified people applying. What are they?

2. Identify the hiring standards that should be avoided in the ad.   

3. What recruitment sources and methods might have been used to have generated a
   better applicant pool for the two software design engineer positionsfor
   International Manufacturing? Defend your recommendations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Dorothy did not specify what skills are needed and what knowledge should be
   possessed by the applicants, thus the job specifications were missing and
   applicant could not identify whether they are suitable for the job or not.
   She also didn't specify the industry in which the job lies. 

2. Wanting applicants to be *in a good appearance*, is a bad hiring standard, as
   it is being subjective and not relevant for the job. Prefering college
   students may count toward a specification that is needed, though wanting
   *recent college graduates* discriminates against age, or so it seems.
   describing the job as fulfilling growth in the industry is a promise that may
   not hold up, thus it should have been avoided.

3. If the company prefers recent college graduates, they could go directly to
   universities for them to recruit from. As young people utilise internet
   recruitment, that could be a valid recruitment method, given recent college
   graduates are young. It does not say anything about working environments, pay
   or similar.
