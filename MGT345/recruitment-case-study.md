## HRM Incident 1: A Problem Ad? 

Dorothy Bryant was the new recruiting supervisor for International Manufacturing
Company in Salt Lake City, Utah. One of Dorothy’s first assignments was to
recruit two software design engineers for International. Design engineers are
hard to recruit because of the difficulty of their training and the high demand
for them. After considering various recruitment alternatives, Dorothy placed the
following ad in a local newspaper with a circulation in excess of 1,000,000:

```

P.O. Box 1515Salt Lake City, UT  84115    

```

More than 300 applications arrived in the first week, and Dorothy was elated.
When she reviewed the applicants, however, it appeared that few people possessed
the desired qualifications for the job.
