## The nature of motivation

The psychological forces that determine the direction of a person's behaviour in
an organisation, a person's level of effort and a person's level of persistence.
Summarising this to the explanation of why people behave the way they do in
organisations.

We care about motivation because we want individuals in an organisation to be
committed and enthusiastic.

Motivation is the activation or energisation of goal-oriented behaviour. Those
activations only occur when their needs / wants are satisfied. To note,
different people have different motivations and are variable receptive to
stimuli.
