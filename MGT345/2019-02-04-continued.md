## Job Analysis

## Job description vs. job specification

provides information regarding the essential tasks, duties responsibilties for
the job. Minimum acceptable qualifications a person needs to perform a
particular job, like requirements seen in a job advertisement. Job analyis
impacts every aspeect of HR practice, staffing, training/development,
performance appraisal, compensation, safety/health, employee relations and legal
considerations, all in terms of the job. E.g. compensation considering
health/safety implications. A heavy lifting worker may get higher compensation
for the extra manual labour intensivity.

### Content of a Job Description

**Job Identififcation**: Job title, department, reporting relationship, and job number or code

**Job Analysis Date**: Aids in identifying job changes that make description
obsolete

**Job Summary** Concise overview of job

**Duties Performed** Major duties of job

### Job Specification

Minimum qualifications worker should possess. Should reflect minimum, not ideal,qualifications. 

#### Problems If Job Specifications Are Inflated

Could systematically eliminate minorities or women from consideration.
Compensation costs could increase. Vacancies could be more difficult to fill.

#### Job analysis of a Bus Driver

**Job Descriptions**   |
---------------------  | ----------
Tasks                  | Driving a Bus
Responsibilities       | Safe transport, serving tickets, communicating with
passengers
Duties                 | punctuality, reliablity
**Job Specifications** |
Knowledge              | Knowing the area/route
Skills                 | Being able to navigate traffic
Abilities              | Driving, Driving license

The job description is worded *"Driving a Bus"*, the job specification would
be *"being able to drive a Bus"*. The job specification can be directly pulled
from the description by rewording what knowledge/skill/ability is entailed by a
certain tasks/responsibility/duty.

## Job Analysis Methods

- Questionnaires
- Observation
- Interviews
- Employee recording
- Method Combinations

The Questionnaire method could entail asking how a work day is organised, what's
done in that time or how often something is done in a given time period. For
some jobs observation can be a hard method, given that observing a professor
grade papers does not give many insights, where as observing manual labour, such
as a warehouse worker, where observations reveal a lot about their job.
Observation is difficult when mental skills are dominant in the job. Interviews
work great with high-level employees such as C-level management. People
participating in job analysis should include at minimum Employee's and
Employee's intermediate supervisors.

### Competencies and Competency model

Competencies refer to an individualâ€™s capability to orchestrate and apply
combinations of knowledge, skills, and abilities consistently over time to
perform work successfully in the required work situations. Competency modeling
specifies and defines all the competencies necessary for success in a group of
jobs that are set within an industry context.

## Job Design

## Job Enrichment / Enlargement

Basic changes in content and level of responsibility of job to provide greater
challenge to worker. Provides a vertical expansion of responsibilities.
Horizontal Enrichment can be learning about Marketing in Management class. Job
Enlargement is horizontal, where as vertical is called enrichment. Job
Enlargement changes in scope of job to provide greater variety to worker, though
all of the tasks are at the same level of responsibility. This is sometimes
called *cross-training*. 

### Job Rotation

Moving employees from one job to another to broaden their experience. Often
required for higher-level tasks. Can be effective in protecting a company
against the loss of key employees 

### Re-engineering

Re-engineering is fundamental rethinking, a radical redesign of business
processes, which aims to achieve dramatic improvements in critical measures of
performance such as: Cost, Quality, Service, Speed

### Global Talent Management

Strategic endeavor to optimize use of human capital. It enables an organization
to drive short-and long-term results. It builds culture, engagement, capability,
and capacity through integrated talent acquisition, development, and deployment
processes that are aligned to business goals. It means that we look at everyone
at every time. We might have a talented sales man in Zara, where the supervisor
has spotted the potential. To exploit that potential, Job enrichment,
enlargement, rotation or re-engineering can be used by supervisors.

##  Recruitment

Is the process of attracting individuals on a timely basis, in sufficient
numbers and with appropriate qualifications. Recruitment encourages people to
apply for jobs.

Process](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/mondyhrm13inppt05-150216192940-conversion-gate01/95/mondy-hrm13-inppt05ppt-21-638.jpg?cb=1424115150)

### Employee Requisition

Recruitment begins with employee requisitions. It is a document specifying the
job title, the department, the date the employee is needed by.

## Internal Recruitment Models

- Human resource databases
- Job posting means advertising the job internally
    - Procedure to inform employees of existing job openings
- Job bidding means having people bid for the position
- Employee referral
    - Is the number one way workers find a job. Referrals are better qualified
      and stay on job longer. Employee referral recruits new hires through
      employee-referral incentive program. 

## External Recruitment Models

External Recruitment is necessary as entry level jobs have to be filled to acquire skills not possessed by current labour body. It brings different backgrounds and cultural mixture to the workforce to provide diversity in ideas.

### External Recruitment Sources

- High schools and vocational schools
    - Entry-level employees and Clerical
    - Some companies work with schools
    - Companies can loan employees to schools for training
- Community colleges
    - Sensitive to local employment needs
    - High demand for students with marketable skills
- Colleges & Universities
    - Technical / high level employees
- Competitors in the labour market
    - Relevant experience / skills needed already present
    - Smaller firms can *poach* employees from bigger organisations
- Unemployed labour
    - Qualified applicants become unemployed every day
    - Companies go out of business, cut back operations or merge with other
      firms, which may lead to employees being laid off.

Depending on employees sought after, traditional as well as modern tools can
help find and employ these resources. Traditional methods could include Job
fairs or Internships.

### Tailoring recruitment methods to sources

Firms are different from each other, thus recruitment methods have to be
tailored suitably.

### Active and Passive Job Seekers

Active job seekers are commited to finding another job. Where as passive
candidates are typically employed, satisfied with their employer, content and
current role, but still open to improvements. For these distinct groups of
people, recruitment strategies / methods differ.
 
### Legal Considerations

The first contact between employer and candidate is made during the recruitment
process. It is essential to emphasize *nondiscriminatory practices*. The U.S.
department of labour has issued guidelines concerning online recruitment
policies.
