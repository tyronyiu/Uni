## Job Analysis

## Job description vs. job specification

provides information regarding the essential tasks, duties responsibilties for
the job. Minimum acceptable qualifications a person needs to perform a
particular job, like requirements seen in a job advertisement. Job analyis
impacts every aspect of HR practice, staffing, training/development,
performance appraisal, compensation, safety/health, employee relations and legal
considerations, all in terms of the job. E.g. compensation considering
health/safety implications. A heavy lifting worker may get higher compensation
for the extra manual labour intensivity.

### Content of a Job Description

**Job Identififcation**: Job title, department, reporting relationship, and job number or code

**Job Analysis Date**: Aids in identifying job changes that make description
obsolete

**Job Summary** Concise overview of job

**Duties Performed** Major duties of job

### Job Specification

Minimum qualifications worker should possess. Should reflect minimum, not ideal,qualifications. 

#### Problems If Job Specifications Are Inflated

Could systematically eliminate minorities or women from consideration.
Compensation costs could increase. Vacancies could be more difficult to fill.

#### Job analysis of a Bus Driver

**Job Descriptions**   |
---------------------  | ----------
Tasks                  | Driving a Bus
Responsibilities       | Safe transport, serving tickets, communicating with
passengers
Duties                 | punctuality, reliablity
**Job Specifications** |
Knowledge              | Knowing the area/route
Skills                 | Being able to navigate traffic
Abilities              | Driving, Driving license

The job description is worded *"Driving a Bus"*, the job specification would
be *"being able to drive a Bus"*. The job specification can be directly pulled
from the description by rewording what knowledge/skill/ability is entailed by a
certain tasks/responsibility/duty.

## Job Analysis Methods

- Questionnaires
- Observation
- Interviews
- Employee recording
- Method Combinations

The Questionnaire method could entail asking how a work day is organised, what's
done in that time or how often something is done in a given time period. For
some jobs observation can be a hard method, given that observing a professor
grade papers does not give many insights, where as observing manual labour, such
as a warehouse worker, where observations reveal a lot about their job.
Observation is difficult when mental skills are dominant in the job. Interviews
work great with high-level employees such as C-level management. People
participating in job analysis should include at minimum Employee's and
Employee's intermediate supervisors.

### Competencies and Competency model

Competencies refer to an individualâ€™s capability to orchestrate and apply
combinations of knowledge, skills, and abilities consistently over time to
perform work successfully in the required work situations. Competency modeling
specifies and defines all the competencies necessary for success in a group of
jobs that are set within an industry context.

## Job Design

## Job Enrichment / Enlargement

Basic changes in content and level of responsibility of job to provide greater
challenge to worker. Provides a vertical expansion of responsibilities.
Horizontal Enrichment can be learning about Marketing in Management class. Job
Enlargement is horizontal, where as vertical is called enrichment. Job
Enlargement changes in scope of job to provide greater variety to worker, though
all of the tasks are at the same level of responsibility. This is sometimes
called *cross-training*. 

### Job Rotation

Moving employees from one job to another to broaden their experience. Often
required for higher-level tasks. Can be effective in protecting a company
against the loss of key employees 

### Re-engineering

Re-engineering is fundamental rethinking, a radical redesign of business
processes, which aims to achieve dramatic improvements in critical measures of
performance such as: Cost, Quality, Service, Speed

### Global Talent Management

Strategic endeavor to optimize use of human capital. It enables an organization
to drive short-and long-term results. It builds culture, engagement, capability,
and capacity through integrated talent acquisition, development, and deployment
processes that are aligned to business goals. It means that we look at everyone
at every time. We might have a talented sales man in Zara, where the supervisor
has spotted the potential. To exploit that potential, Job enrichment,
enlargement, rotation or re-engineering can be used by supervisors.

##  Recruitment

Is the process of attracting individuals on a timely basis, in sufficient
numbers and with appropriate qualifications. Recruitment encourages people to
apply for jobs.

![The Recruitment
Process](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/mondyhrm13inppt05-150216192940-conversion-gate01/95/mondy-hrm13-inppt05ppt-21-638.jpg?cb=1424115150)

### Employee Requisition

Recruitment begins with employee requisitions. It is a document specifying the
job title, the department, the date the employee is needed by.

## Internal Recruitment Models

- Human resource databases
- Job posting means advertising the job internally
    - Procedure to inform employees of existing job openings
- Job bidding means having people bid for the position
- Employee referral
    - Is the number one way workers find a job. Referrals are better qualified
      and stay on job longer. Employee referral recruits new hires through
      employee-referral incentive program. 

## External Recruitment Models

External Recruitment is necessary as entry level jobs have to be filled to acquire skills not possessed by current labour body. It brings different backgrounds and cultural mixture to the workforce to provide diversity in ideas.

### External Recruitment Sources

- High schools and vocational schools
    - Entry-level employees and Clerical
    - Some companies work with schools
    - Companies can loan employees to schools for training
- Community colleges
    - Sensitive to local employment needs
    - High demand for students with marketable skills
- Colleges & Universities
    - Technical / high level employees
- Competitors in the labour market
    - Relevant experience / skills needed already present
    - Smaller firms can *poach* employees from bigger organisations
- Unemployed labour
    - Qualified applicants become unemployed every day
    - Companies go out of business, cut back operations or merge with other
      firms, which may lead to employees being laid off.

Depending on employees sought after, traditional as well as modern tools can
help find and employ these resources. Traditional methods could include Job
fairs or Internships.

### Tailoring recruitment methods to sources

Firms are different from each other, thus recruitment methods have to be
tailored suitably.

### Active and Passive Job Seekers

Active job seekers are commited to finding another job. Where as passive
candidates are typically employed, satisfied with their employer, content and
current role, but still open to improvements. For these distinct groups of
people, recruitment strategies / methods differ.
 
### Legal Considerations

The first contact between employer and candidate is made during the recruitment
process. It is essential to emphasize *nondiscriminatory practices*. The U.S.
department of labour has issued guidelines concerning online recruitment
policies.

#### Labour department guidelines

- keep detailed records
- identify criteria used in recruitment processes
- be able to explain why a person with protected status was not hired

### Alternatives to Recruitment

**Promotion policies** can be implemented from within, effectively filling
vacancies above entry-level positions with current employees. It gives
incentives to strive for advancements. As organisations are usually aware of
employees capabilities, it accounts often for around 80%.

#### Overtime

Most commonly used method for meeting short-term fluctuations in work volume. It
avoids recruitment, selection and training costs and employees benefit from
increased profit, though problems can arise and overtime is not a sustainable
method for filling vacancies, as employees will probably not normalise to
overtime level work loads.

#### Onshoring

Describes the movement of jobs not to another country but lower cost american
cities. The government may require onshore handling of certain sensible data
such as financial, health or defense data. 

#### reshoring

Reverse of offshoring and involves bringing work back to the united states. 

#### Outsourcing and offshoring

**Outsourcing**
: Transfers responsibility to external provider

**Offshoring**
: Migration of all or a significant part of development, maintenance and
delivery of services to vendors located in another country.

**Reshoring**
: The reverse of *offshoring* and involves bringing work back to the united
states or the country of origin.

## Selection

Is the process of choosing the individual best suited for a particular position
and organisation from a group of applicant. Thus, it is the goal to properly
match people with jobs and organisations. Selecting the wrong person for any job
is very costly usually, which is why selection is vital.

```

### Preliminary screening

Removes obviously unqualified individuals. The benefit is that the applicant may
be qualified for another position within the firm. 

### Review of applicants

Essential information is included and standardised, such as CV's resumÃ©e's et
cetera. Application forms must reflect the firm's informational needs and EEO
(equal employment opportunities) requirements. 

'### Review of resumes

*RÃ©sumÃ©*
: Goal directed summary of a person's experience, education and
training, developed for use in the selection process.

Professional applicants often begin selection process by submitting resume's.
The concept of relevancy is crucial in selling the applicant to the company.

#### RÃ©sumÃ©s and keywords

Most large companies now use automated tracking systems for identifying keywords
in ones rÃ©sumÃ©. Keywords are job-related words or phrases.

#### Selection Tests

Are reliable and accurate means of selecting qualified candidates. The cost is
relatively small to e.g. assessment centers. They identify attitudes and
job-related skills that interviews cannot recognise.

#### Characteristics of properly designed selection tests

**Standardisation**
: Uniformity of procedures and conditions of administering a test.  

**Objectivity**
: Everyone scoring a test obtains same results.  

**Norms**
: Frame of reference for comparing applicant's performance with that of others.  

**Reliability**
: Provides consistent results

**Validity**
: Measures what it is supposed to measure (basic requirement)

**Requirement for job relatedness**
: Must not have adverse impact on minorities, females and individuals with
background or characteristics protected under law.

#### Test validation Approaches

**Criterion-related validity**
: Comparing scores on selection tests to some aspect of job performance.

**Content validity**
: Includes certain tasks actually required by the job.

**Construct validity**
: Measures certain traits or qualities important in performing a job.

**Concurrent validity**
: Obtaining test scores and the criterion data at essentially the same time.

**Predictive validity**
: Administering a test and later obtaining the criterion information.


> The goal is to validate the selection test. Is our test valid and doing what it
> is supposed to do?

#### Employment Test

**Achievement test**
: A test of current knowledge / skills.

**Cognitive ability test**
: A test that determines general reasoning ability, memory, vocabulary, verbal
fluency and numerical abilities.

**Aptitude test**
: A test of how well a person can learn or acquire skills or abilities.

#### Unique forms of testing

Graphonalysis, also known as handwriting analysis has been used in the past but
has been out of date for quite some time. The context in which *graphonanalysis* is
mentioned in is along with astrology or psychic readings. Polygraph test (lie
detector tests) can refute or confirm application information, but also not used
in the private sector.

### Employment Interview

Goal oriented conservation where interviewer and applicant exchange information
relevant to the application process. At this point, candidates are already
assumed to be qualified, as the screening process through the handed in
application has already been completed. The interview selection method is one of
the main methods used.

#### Interview planning

Developing a job profile based on job description / specification is important
so the questions prepared relate to the qualities / characteristics needed
(value generating questions).

#### Contents of the interview

The goal is to seek additional job-related information and examples of past
job-related behaviours. Such can be the past occupational experience, academic
achievements, interpersonal skills that need to be tested in person or personal
qualities that are not clear on paper. Information about the company, the job
and the expectations that the job brings along should be communicated to the
applicant.

### Types of Interviews

#### Unstructured

Asks probing, open-ended questions. The goal is to encourage the applicant to
do much of the talking. It is often time consuming and can entail potential
legal issues. Much information that could be interpreted as irrelevant and
conclusion misleading, but may be brought up by the candidate, thus a racial or
religious statement could end up entailing potential legal issues, given that
the interviewer was aware, even if not intended.

#### Structured

Is a series of job-related questions asked each applicant. There is an increased
reliability and accuracy by reducing subjectivity and inconsistencies of
unstructured interviews. E.g. Comparing free/open discussions is hard, thus a
set of questions may standardise responses to analyse.

#### Behavioural

Behavioural questions prompt applicant of relate actual incidents relevant to
target job. There are three aspects to look out for, the description of a
challenging situation, what the candidate did about it and the measurable
results. An example could be the description of a situation where one was
responsible for motivating others.

#### Situational

Creates hypothetical situations candidates would be likely to encounter on the
job and ask how they would handle them. E.g. One of your employees has shown
significant decline in productivity, how to handle this?


Behavioural Vs. Situational compare in the way that behavioural is what has
happened and how one acted, while Situational is how one would act, given the
hypothetical situation.

### Methods of Interviewing

**One-on-one Interview**
: Applicant meets with one interviewer

**Group Interview**
: Several applicant interact in presence of one or more interviewers

**Board Interview**
: Several firm representatives interview candidate at the same time

**Multiple Interviews**
: Applicants typically interviewed one-on-one by peers, subordinates and
supervisors.

### Realistic Job Previews

Provide both positive and negative job information to applicant in unbiased
manner. They convey information about tasks person would perform and behaviour
required to fit into organisation's culture.

### Potential Interviewing Problems

Inappropriate questions and permitting non-job related information as relevant
can cause problems. Just as well as the bias of the interviewer towards the
candidate or the interviewer domination. There may be a lack of training an
nonverbal communication problems.

### Inappropriate Questions

There is a basic rule, such as only asking job-related questions. The
*interview* was a test, subject to same validity requirements as any other step
in the selection process. Historically, the interview has been most vulnerable
to charges due to discriminiation than any other selection method.

### Permitting non-job-related information

If a candidate begins volunteering personal information not related to the Job,
interviewer should steer the conversation back on course. Engaging in friendly
chitchat may be pleasant and productive towards the interview harmonic
atmoshphere. In our litigous society, it may be the most dangerous thing
interviewers can do.
