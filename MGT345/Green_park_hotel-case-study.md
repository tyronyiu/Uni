## Case-Study

> Green Park Hotel is a well-established, medium-sized hotel on the outskirts of
> the city. Due to its location, it traditionally generates more trade from
> business guests, conferences and functions than from holidaymakers. The
> management team prides itself in the level of customer service and
> professionalism that is demonstrated throughout the hotel. This is
> particularly important in terms of retaining business from a few large and
> influential organisations, which regularly use the hotel facilities. Due to
> recent internal promotions, a vacancy exists for a receptionist who will be
> responsible for greeting visitors, answering telephone enquiries, and checking
> guests in and out of the hotel. Owing to shift patterns, the receptionist must
> be able to operate on their own at different times of the day. Over the past
> two days, the head receptionist and another hotel manager have interviewed
> seven candidates who were shortlisted following a recent newspaper
> advertisement, as well as one internal candidate. The advertand job
> description highlighted the following criteria as being essential for the
> post: at least one year’s hotel reception experience, excellent customer
> service skills, experience of using a busy switchboard, good keyboard
> skills.Following the interviews, five candidates have been rejected as
> unsuitable and three candidates are still being considered, although none of
> them fulfil all the criteria for the post:

1. Since leaving college two years ago, Janehas worked as a receptionist with a
small manufacturing company in the city. She has no hotel experience and
although she operates a switchboard, it would appear to be much less demanding
than the hotel switchboard. Jane came across very well in the interview, with a
very positive attitude and good evidence of customer service focus. She appears
genuinely interested in moving into a career in the hotel industry and would be
willing to undertake a relevant college course. Currently, she works a regular
Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm week.

2. Matthew is an internal candidate who has been employed in the hotel as a
barman for the past three years. He is used to working shifts, including split
shifts and has done so willingly. Matthew is very popular with the guests and
locals who use the bar, and regularly receives an excellent rating for customer
service in his performance review. Matthew is interested in transferring to
reception as he feels that there is no scope for personal development or a
career path as a barman. He is willing to undertake any in-house training
required but is unsure about college courses, as it is a long time since he
studied. He has a home computer and has taught himself to use a range of
packages, but has no formal experience of operating switchboards or reception
work.

3. Laura is a mature woman who is currently unemployed, although she has
previously worked as a head receptionist for three years with a large hotel
chain. Laura has not worked for the last seven years as she took time out to
raise a family. Now that her two children are both at school, she is keen to get
back to the kind of work she loves. Laura has no issue about working shifts and
she presented at the interview glowing references from her previous employer.
Laura has experience of all the key receptionist functions, although some of her
skills need to be updated. The hotel’s computer system is much more
sophisticated and her keyboard skills are very rusty.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Although she is ready to get a college degree, put in the effort required,
she does not have the necessary skills at the moment. 

2. Matthew would ultimately return in an within hire, promotion as a recruitment
method. He has the advantage of knowing the premises and the processes of the
hotel. He also does not have all the necessary skills, but is ready to acquire
those missing. He is not sure about being ready to go to college, but that is
not necessarily required. Considering that he would maybe leave if not getting
the receptionists job, due to him thinking there is no career future for him as
a bar man.

3. Laura doesnt have the skills on the level required, though has experience in
the business. Training would as well as with the other candidates be required.
She only worked in the industry for three years, same as Matthew.

```

### Designing the selection process method

Interviews were conducted with Jane, Matthew and Laura, thus let's stick with
this method, alternatively tests could be conducted to assess the
appropriateness of them for the job. The required skills need to be assessed,
thus the questions should be revolving around gaining insights about the aspects
the questions refer to.
