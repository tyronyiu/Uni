Nearly all firms utilise employment compliance documents.

## TD methods

- The Classroom method
- E-learning
- Case study 
- Behavior modeling 
- Role playing 
- Apprenticeship training
- Team training 
- Training (business) games 
- In-basket training
- On-the-job training

### The Classroom method

- Continues to be effective for many types of employee training
- Conveys great deal of information in a relatively short time 
- Allows for real-time discussion 
- Charisma or personality that the instructor brings to class 

### E-Learning 
- T&D method for online instruction 
- Takes advantage of technology for greater flexibility of instruction 
- Often most convenient delivery method for adult learners 
- Major advantage is cost

### Live Virtual Classroom
- Uses web-based platform to deliver live, instructor-led training to geographically dispersed learners
- Training can now be provided in blocks of time 
- Provides both cost savings and convenience

### Case Study
- Trainees study the information provided by the case 
- Make decisions based on it 
- Often used with instructor who serves as facilitator

### Behavior Modeling 
- Trainees learn by copying or replicating behaviors of others 
- Shows managers how to handle various situations 

### Behavior Modeling and Twittering 
Twittering can be a way to augment behavior modeling 
- A person who excels at a task sends out frequent updates about what he or she is doing 
- Select exemplary performers to post regularly, and pick those who should follow their posts

### Role-Playing
- Participants respond to specific problems they encounter in jobs by acting out real-world situations 
- Used to teach skills such as:
- Interviewing
- Grievance handling
- Performance appraisal reviews
- Conference leadership
- Team problem solving
- Communication

### Training Games
- Aid in group dynamic process
- Encourage learner involvement and stimulate interest
- Retain 75% of the knowledge they acquire when playing games

### Business Games 
- Permit participants to assume roles such as president, controller, or marketing vice president of two or more similar hypothetical organizations 
- Compete against each other by manipulating selected factors in a particular business situation

### In-Basket Training

Participant is asked to establish priorities for and then handle number of typical:
- Business papers or e-mail messages 
- Memoranda
- Reports
- Telephone messages 

### On-the-Job Training
- Informal T&D method 
- Permits employee to learn job tasks by actually performing them 
- Most commonly used T&D method
- No problem transferring what has been learned to the actual task

### Apprenticeship Training
- Combines classroom instruction with on-the-job training
- Traditionally used in skilled trade jobs
- Earns less than master *craftsperson* who is instructor

### Team Training
- Focuses on imparting knowledge and skills on individuals who are expected to work collectively toward meeting a common objective
- Two types:
- Team coordination training
- Cross-training

### Training & Development Delivery Systems 
- Corporate universities 
- Colleges and universities 
- Community colleges 
- Online higher education 
- Vestibule system 
- Video media 
- Simulators
- Social networking 

### Corporate Universities
- Delivery system provided under umbrella of organization
- Focused on creating organizational change
- Proactive and strategic
- Recent years have seen decline of corporate universities 

### Colleges and Universities 
- Primary method for training professional, technical, and management employees 
- Corporate training programs often partner with colleges and universities 

### Community Colleges
- Publicly funded higher education 
- Deliver vocational training and associate degree programs 
- Rapid technological changes and corporate restructuring have created new demand

### Online Higher Education 
- Educational opportunities include degree and training programs 
- Delivered either entirely or partially via Internet 
- Allows employees to attend class at lunchtime, during day, or in evening 
- Reduces or eliminates commute to school 

#### Types of Online Higher Education
- Hybrid programs
- Online synchronized study 
- Asynchronous learning

### Vestibule System
- Occurs away from production area
- Uses equipment that closely resembles equipment actually used on the job 
- Removes employee from pressure to produce while learning
- Emphasis on learning skills required for job

### Simulators
- Devices or programs that are located away from the job site 
- Replicate actual job demands 
- Example: Flight simulators used to train pilots

### Informal Training through Social Networking
- Today’s employees interact, learn, and work in much different ways and styles 
- Often takes place outside the corporate training departments
- Constructivism: Teacher guides the learner toward multiple learning sources, rather than acting as the sole source of knowledge

### Implementing Human Resource Development Programs
- Often difficult
- Many managers are action-oriented and feel they are too busy to engage in T&D efforts
- Qualified trainers must be available
- T&D requires a high degree of creativity

### Metrics for Evaluating Training and Development
- Reactions
- Learning
- Behavior
- Organizational results
- Benchmarking 

### Reactions
- Measure level of customer satisfaction 
- Overall experience could bias some reports
- Good way to quickly and inexpensively obtain feedback

### Learning 
- Determines what participants have learned 
- Pre-test/post-test control group design
- Differences are attributed to training provided  
- Problem: Controlling external variables
    - We also port-test the control group, as the effects of the training takes
      time to show itsels within the teams that were trained.

### Behavior
- Tests give little insight into whether participants will change their behavior 
- Best demonstration of value is when learning translates into lasting behavioral change
- Transfer of training:
- Generalization
- Maintenance 

### Organizational Results
- Asks whether training programs have actually impacted company performance
- Example: Comparing accident rates before and after training provides a useful
  metric of success 

### Return-on-Investment from Training 
- Example of an organizational results in training metric
- Highest level of determining training effectiveness is return-on-investment (ROI) from training 
- CEOs want to see value in terms that they can appreciate, such as business impact, business alignment, and return-on-investment 

### Benchmarking 
- Example of an organizational results in training metric
- Process of monitoring and measuring firm’s internal processes, such as
  operations, and then comparing data with information from companies that excel
  in those areas 
- Focus on metrics, such as training costs, ratio of training staff to
  employees, and whether new or more traditional delivery systems are used 

### Factors Influencing T&D
- Top management support
- Shortage of skilled workers
- Technological advances
- Global complexity 
- Learning styles
- Other human resource functions

### Top Management Support
- Without it, T&D program will not succeed
- Most effective way to achieve success is for executives to provide needed resources to support T&D effort
- Training professionals are having to do more with less

### Shortage of Skilled Workers
- Major shortages of future skilled workers
- Employers are begging for skilled workers
- Training needs are changing
- Executives are increasingly demanding additional skills

### Technological Advances
- Change is occurring at an amazing speed 
- Knowledge doubling every year
- No factor has influenced T&D more than technology

### Global Complexity
- World is getting more complex
- Entire world provides opportunities and threats
- How will training change in this global environment?

### Learning Styles
- No best way to learn that suits everyone
- Need to use a wide range of training methods
- Adults retain:
- 20% of what they read and hear 
- 40% of what they see 
- 50% of what they say 
- 60% of what they do 
- 90% of what they see, hear, say, and do

### Other HR Functions
- Other human resource functions can also have crucial impact on T&D
- If recruitment-and-selection efforts or its compensation package attract only marginally qualified workers, firm will need extensive T&D programs
- Safety and health programs also affected

### HR Training Initiatives
- Orientation (onboarding)
- Ethics
    - such could be the consideration bullying or sexual assaults
- Compliance (e.g., Equal Employment Opportunity)
- Diversity
- Safety

### Orientation (Onboarding)
- Initial T&D effort designed for employees
- Goal is to inform them about company, job, and workgroup
- Helps them decide whether or not to stay at a company within their first 6 months 

### Purposes of Orientation
- Employment situation
- Company policies and rules
- Compensation and benefits
- Corporate culture
- Team membership
- Employee development
- Socialization

### Career
- General course person chooses to pursue throughout working life
- Sequence of work-related positions an individual has occupied

#### Career Path
- Flexible line of movement through which person may travel during work life
- Various career paths, some of which are traditional and others that have developed as the employment relationship has changed

#### Types of Career Paths
- Traditional career path
- Network career path
- Lateral skill path
- Dual career path
- Adding value to your career
- Demotion
- Free agents (being one’s own boss)

#### Traditional Career Path
- Employee progresses vertically in organization from one specific job to the next
- Not as viable a career path option today

#### Network Career Path
- Both vertical job sequence and horizontal opportunities
- Experience interchangeable at certain levels
- Broad experience at one level needed before promotion to next level 

#### Lateral Skill Path
- Involves lateral moves within company
- Employee becomes revitalized and finds new challenges
- No pay or promotion involved
- Offers opportunities to develop new skills

#### Dual Career Path
- Technical specialists contribute expertise without having to become managers
- Often established to encourage and motivate professionals

#### Adding Value to Retain Present Job
- Workers view themselves as independent contractors who must constantly improve their skills to continually add value to organization
- Workers need to develop own plan and “toolbox” of personal skills

#### Demotion
- More realistic option today, due to limited promotional opportunities and fast pace of technological change
- Senior employee can escape unwanted stress without being a failure

#### Free Agents
Take charge of all or part of career by being own boss or working for others in ways that fit particular needs or wants


#### Career Planning
- Ongoing process whereby an individual:
    - Sets career goals 
    - Identifies means to achieve them
- Does not necessarily entail promotions
- Flexible process with multiple contingencies for life’s work
- Should evaluate abilities and interests
- Self-assessment and formal methods

#### Career Planning: The Self-Assessment 
- Process of learning about oneself

- Not a singular event 
- A continuous process 
- Individual responsibility

#### Strength/Weakness Balance Sheet 
- Self-evaluation process developed by Benjamin Franklin
- Assists people in becoming aware of strengths and weaknesses 
- Individual lists perceived strengths and weaknesses 
- Perception of weakness often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy
