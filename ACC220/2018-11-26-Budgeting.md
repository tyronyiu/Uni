A *budget* is a business plan for the short term. Financial terms are main
aspect and objective is to plan actionable blueprints out of strategy.
- Continual budget
- periodic budget
- rolling budget

Periodic budgets are time period specific, where as rolling budgets are
continually updates. They promote forward thinking, performance motivation,
provide a system of authorisation and control as well as aids coordination.

> Budgeting is a business plan for short term (1yr or less) represented in
financial terms.

A *forecast* is a prediction of the future state of the environment. They can be
helpful for budget setters, though are separate.

> A forecast is a future prediction about the state of the environment, economy
or industry in general. Businesses use forecast information in order to prepare
relevant budgets.

## Five elements of Budgeting

[Five elements of a good budget. (2018). RateCity.com.au. Retrieved 26 November 2018, from https://www.ratecity.com.au/savings-accounts/articles/five-elements-of-a-good-budget]()


## Planning and control processes

- Establish objective
- Positional Analysis (SWOT, PESTEL)
- Strategic Options (Mergers, market entry)
- Formulate long-term strategy (using the options)
- Prepare budgets for given strategy
- Measure actual performance
- Variances in actual and planned/budgeted performance
- Respond to variances
- Revise Budget
 
## The interrelationship of operating budgets

Do I have all resources for my production? First measure is the sales budget.
Production budget triggers the amount spent on overheads, labour and
materials. E.G. credit sale: Trade receivables, but the actual cash comes in
later. Now, that cash is used for paying overheads, labour etc. 

*figure 6.2*

## The vertical relationship between a business's sales budget

Segmenting a business into departments/geographic units, will allow to allocate
an overall budget and create sub-budgets for various regions.

## The Budget-setting process

*p. 204*

*Who should set the budget?* - Senior managers, as they have the authority,
responsibility, but most of all the experience to do so. Also they have the most
general overview of the business. They are no accountants, thus a **budget officer** 
is used to actually deliver the budget plan.

### Communicate budget plans to managers

Considerations about macro-forces will influence the second step. 

### Limiting factors

Identifying limiting factors is key, factors such as production capacity, cash
limits or sales readiness. These can be overcome by e.g. financing via a loan or
acquiring further machinery.

### Draft budget adaption to other areas

- Top-down approach
- Bottom-up approach

Once limiting factors are identified (e.g. market demand). Direct labour budget,
machinery budgets. *Top-down* budgeting originates in senior management, where
as *bottom-up* budgeting originate from lower levels and makes it way up the
production hierarchy. There are problems with both approaches, like bottom-up
budgeting often being over-sized and top-down budgeting too tight and
authoritarian. The bottom-up approach creates necessity for cross-hierarchy
negotiations and cooperation. In the bottom-up approach departments feel involved in the process of setting their own budget.

### Review & Coordinate

Marketing department, production department etc. all these departments have to
be balanced within the set budget plan. The higher-level managers have to
overview these steps so that budget segmentation stays balanced.

### Master budget

- Income statement 
- Balance sheet
- Cash flow statement 

By looking at total performance, total expenses and total revenue or total
asset/liability distribution and cash capacity, budgets have to be created for
each of those statements.

## The cash budget

(know this!)
Does this business have enough money for everything to come?

- Money coming in - Receivables (receivables are coming in one month later than
  date of sale)

**CHANGE THIS**

*p. 216* shows opening/closing balance.

The april period is negative, but may and june positive. The problem is that the
cash is not arriving on time. Instead of paying all of the machinery (110,000)
at once, payment options may be negotiated with the supplier to avoid having
negative balance.

## Continual Vs. Periodic Budgeting

Continual Budgets are also called rolling Budgets, their featuring aspect lies
in the fact, that they are never-ending. The period of relevance is renewed , a
new month added to the end, while the first is removed, every month. This allows
lower costs, as models are adjusted based on the recent
circumstances/performance. 

Periodic Budgeting sets a clear time period, for which a budget is intended.

p.198

## Zero based Vs. Incremental Budgeting

Zero based budgets are identified with the fact, that they are started *from
zero* every month. Incremental budgeting is based upon the prior performance.
Thus continual and periodic budgets can be subclasses of zero based and incremental
budgeting.

p.209

## Activity Based Budgeting

Same element as activity based costing, the activities rather than the materials
count.
