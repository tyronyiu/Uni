Full cost of product for one unit = total cost / number of units

### Job Costing ( multiple products ) 

```  
Direct labour 
+
Direct material 
+
Indirect overheads included
---------------
Total Cost
  |
  |
  +--->  direct labour hour basis
  |
  +--->  machine hour basis

```

$\text{Overhead absorption rate} = \frac{\text{Total overheads}}/{\text{direct labour hours / total machine hours}}$


For every hour of direct labour hour worked a surcharge can be applied.


## Practice Question 2:

**BasilLtd**
You  have  been  asked  to  suggest  a  method  of  deducing  the  full  cost  of  various production orders of Basil Ltd. This method will be used as a basis for setting prices. The production orders vary greatly in size and nature from one to the next.The  following  information  has  been  taken  from  the  budget for  the  forthcoming financial year:

```
Direct labour       |    £400,000
Direct materials    |    £100,000
Overheads           |    £450,000
Direct materials    |    10,000 kg
Direct labour hours |    50,000 hours 
Machine hours       |    45,000 hours
-------------------------------------
                         £950,000
```

The business is not departmentalised for accounting purposes.
All direct labour is paid the same hourly rate. 


Basil Ltd has currently received a new order which has the following costs:

```
Direct materials    |  450 kg
Direct labour hours |  2,000 hours
Machine hours       |  500 hours
``` 

(a)  Prepare  full  costings for the new  order using the  following  methods  allocating total overheads:
-overhead rate based on labour hour basis
-overhead rate based on machine hour basis

```  
Direct material: £100,000/10,000 kg = £10 per kg
  450 kg * £10 = £450

Direct Labour: £400,000/50,000 hours = £8 per hour
  2,000 hours * £8 = £16,000

Indirect Cost: 
  2,000 hours * 9 £ per hour = £18,000
======================================

Full Cost: £38,500

<br>
<br>

Direct material: £4,500

Direct Labour: £16,000

Indirect: 500 hours * 10 £ per hour = £5,000
============================================

Full Cost: £25,500

Direct labour method:
  OAR = £450,000/50,000 hours = £9 per hour

Machine labour method:
  OAR = £450,000/45,000 hours = £10 per hour

``` 

(b) State briefly which of the two bases of overheads you prefer and why. 

In allocating indirect (overhead) cost to different jobs, we should analyse the make-up of total overheads. 
If most of the total overheads relate to machinery (depreciation, repair & maintenance of the machine, as well as any other machine related cost), we use the **machine hour basis.** Otherwise, we use the **direct labour basis.**


## Activity 4.8

We use direct Labour method, because the bigger a project, the bigger the costs involved regarding labour, such as insurance, wages, etc.
The longer the time taken for a project, the more expensive it becomes.
Direct labour hours are capable of being measured for each job.
They will normally be measured to deduce the direct labour element of cost in any case.
Thus, a direct labour hour basis of dealing with overheads is practical to apply in the real world.

Figure 4.2 shows the contribution of direct labour to different jobs.

## Example 4.3 (page 114 or so)

## Segmenting overheads (page 132 Activity 4.13)

If we want more accurate allocation of indirect costs, we can use overhead segmentation.

```  
OAR = 12,000 / 1,600 = 7.5 per direct labour hour
OAR(2) = 8,000 / 1,000 = 8 per machine hour

Direct Labour hour basis:     Job 1 |  Job 2
------------------------------------+---------
                                    |
                                    |
Machine hour basis:                 |
                                    |
                                    |
```
