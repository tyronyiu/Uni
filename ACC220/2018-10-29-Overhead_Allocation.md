## Overhead allocation and estimation errors

Overhead absorption rate (OAR) should be calculated at the start of the
financial year, hence we use estimated numbers for total overheads as well as
direct labour or machine hours. At the end of the financial year, the adjustment
is required for estimation errors. 

### Over-absorption

If estimated overheads is more than actual overheads.
Extra income to be recognised.

$$ E > A $$

### Under-absorption

If estimated overhads are less than actual overheads.

$$ E < A $$
