Reasons for dividing a business into departments include:

- Size and complexity
- Expertise ( my dad knows his market and profession ) 
- Accountability ( Each department has responsibility ) 

Each department that is a cost center should be departmentalised.
Each department should be treated as another business entity.
More than a third of the businesses in the uk have more than 20 cost centres.

### Product cost center

Departments involved in the direct production line.
The actual product is being made at this stage.
Direct cost involvement.

Preparation department: rent = 200,000  
Finishing department: mechanical engineer wage = 100,000  
Direct material + direct labour + a share of the preparation department overheads

e.g. preparation department, painting department, finishing department  
These are two different overheads that are seen to be sourced from two different business units.

### Service cost center

All other services that support the business.
There is no direct cost involved.
Departments like maintenance, training etc.

e.g. HR department.

Because Service cost centers are supporting departments, the product cost centers are superpositioned. 

### Steps in having overheads handledon a cost centre basis

1. Allocate specific cost centre
...............

### Apportioned Cost

- Rent
- Insurance of building
- Heating of building
- Cleaning

You are assuming the departments are using the resources equally, but they are contributing differently.
Can be deduced from labour or machine hour basis.
e.g. if floor space is given, the department's usage of e.g. cleaning necessary, can be calculated for each contributing factor (department).

HR department is a service center, e.g.
production center: 600 direct labour + 100 indirect labour  
total overheads: 2,300  
total contribution to reapportion HR cost (by number of staff): 202

### Deriving the cost of one unit where production is in batches.

```
The full cost of the batch, delivered on a 'job-costing' basis.
                            |
                            V
    The number of cost units (products) in the batch.
                            |
                            V
        The full cost of one cost unit (product).
```
$5,000 / 100 \text{ tickets } = 50$

### Variable costing versus full costing

**Variable Costing**  
Includes only variable cost ( direct and indirect in cost of product )
Fixed Cost charged to period when incurred

**Full Costing**  
Includes direct cost ( fixed and variable in cost of product )

## Example 4.7 

Answer in the back of the book.

Lahore ltd commenced operations on first of June and makes a single product, which sells for 14 per unit. (...)

**Variable costing:**  
Direct cost for a product may be labour and material cost, where as indirect cost may be the depreciation of machinery.  

**Full costing:**   
Having sold 4000 out of 6000 units, and a indirect cost of 3 pound per unit, the $4,000 \text{ units } * 3 \text{ pounds } = 12,000 \text{ pounds }$ are included in full cost. 

### Relevant Costing ( Example 2.7 page 60 )
