## Operating gearing

Where operating gearing is relatively high, as in the diagram, a small amount of motion in the profit gear is the result.
Small change in volume of ouptut, affects profit greatly.
High capital, higher risk business, higher gearing.

Increasing the level of operating gearing nakes profit more sensitive to changes in the volume of activity. 

## The economist view of the break-even chart

Limitations to break-even analysis are e.g. the non-consideration of quality, capacity of labour / need for external hire...

## Key areas of decision making using marginal analysis

* Pricing/assessing opportunities to enter contracts
* Determining the most efficient use of scarce resources
* Closing or continuation decisions
Make-or-buy decisions

In a business, in the short term, fixed cost doesn't change (i.e. sunk cost), hence key decisions are made on the basis of contribution. 

**Contribution**
: $\text{Sales} - \text{variable cost}$

### Decision making for scarce resourcs

In a business, key objective is to maximise profit. However, it could be  restricted by limiting factors (labour, material, land, capacity [plant, labour])

If you're in a multi-product environment, we follow certain steps:

1. Calculate contribution per unit
2. Calculate contribution per limiting factor.
3. Priorize what to produce based on step 2.
4. Decide which one to produce first

**Contribution per unit**
: $\text{Selling Price} - \text{Variable cost per unit}$

#### B14
1.
$\text{Selling Price} = 25$
$\text{Variable Cost} = 10$
$\text{Contribution} = 15$

2.
$\frac{15}{4} = 3.75 \text{ per machine hour}$

#### B17

$20\text{ units} * 3\text{ hours} = 60\text{ hours}$

#### B14

$22\text{ units} * 4\text{ hours} = 88\text{ hours}$
