Monthly overhead costs are £25,000. 
Each month 1,000 direct labour hoursare worked and charged to cost units.

* Direct labour hours - 50,000 hours 
* Machine hours - 45,000 hours


## Chapter 3 practice questions

For scarce resources: Contribution per unit (sales - variable cost); Contribution per limiting factor; The higher the contribution for liming factors, the better. 


## Q3: Smith Ltd 

Smith Ltd has three products all of which require the same production facilities.
Financial data on the three products are as follows:

<pre>
Product                     A       B        C
---------------------------------------------------
                                £ per unit   

Selling price per unit (£)     140     180      240 

Variable Cost per unit (£)      80     100       90

Share of fixed overheads        20      20       20

Monthly demand in units (units) 90     100       80

Machine time per unit (hours)    5      10       15

</pre>



## Q4: Lorient PLC

Lorient plc has three products all of which require the same production facilities.
Financial data on the three products are as follows:

<pre>
Product                     X        Y        Z
----------------------------------------------------
                                £ per unit
Labour: 
- skilled                  10       15       20
- unskilled                 3        6        3

Materials                   9       12       15

Variable overheads          8       12       16

share of fixed overheads   10       15       20

</pre>

All three of the products use just one raw material, which is the same material for all three products.
This material costs £12 a kilo and is scarce, such that the amount ofall three products that can be produced falls well below the amounts that the market would take.
All labour is a variable cost. 

Product X is sold in a market where the selling price per unit is fixed at £60. 

**Required:** 
Show,  with  workings  and explanations,  the  price  at  which  the business  would  need to sell products Y and Z such that it would be equally profitable to produce and sell any one of the three products. 


## Self-assessment Chapter 3.1

Khan ltd can render three different types of service using the same staff. Various estimates for next year have been made as follow:

<pre>
Service                     A      B     C
--------------------------------------------------
Selling price (£ per unit) 30     39    20

Variable material cost     15     18    10

other variable cost         6     10     5

Share of fixed cost         8     12     4

Staff time required (hours) 2      3     1

</pre>

fixed cost for the next year is expected to total 40,000.

**Required:**
a) If the business were to render onyl service A neytyear, how many units of the service would it need to provide in order to break even? (Assume for this part of the question that there is no effective limit to market size and staff level)

b) If the business has limited staff hours available next year, in which order of preference would the three services come?

c) The maximum market for next year for the three services is as follow:

<pre>
A  3,000 units

B  2,000 units

C  5,000 units
</pre>

Khan ltd has a maximum of 10,000 staff hours available next year. 
What quantities of each service should the business provide next year and how much profit would this yiel?

## Activity 3.15

Marginal costing = contribution analysis

Theres nothing I can do about fixed cost, so alter contribution

Positive contribution is better than nothing. - Do it.

## Make or buy decisions

### Activity 3.20

produce internall maximising spare capacity.

### Activity 3.21

No spare capacity. Opportunity cost to produce.

Use subcontractor, source out. 

If there is a spare capacity, we compare relative to market prices, and see if we should outsource or produce internally.
