## Superjam

*Conduct the overview of this business in general (product ranges sold, industry overview and nature of the competition)*

Superjam sells all-natural, no added sugar jam, 100% percent made out of pure
fruit. Their UVP is the naturality of the jam and thus the health aspect. 
cookbooks, Gifts (bags/merch)

*Who are their customers and what are their needs?*

Their customers are health-conscious consumers, that value natural food and the
ingredients used for the jam. Their needs are identified by their nature, thus
their interest in the firm and product defines their needs.

*What are the UVP's?*

The natural ingredients used are appealing to health-conscious customers, their
no-sugar maxime is appealing to the consumers that are also falling into the
medical limitations of having sugar in most foods.

*How to use the concepts of quality improvement?*

Target costing is important to predict a future cost, for referencing financing
needed, or minimum profit required prior. Kaizen costing implements continuous
optimisation and thus delivers the value of membership to the exploiting labour
force. That increases quality long-term steadily. Having performances measured,
referenced and relatively compared to other parties such as competitiors, past
snapshots, future outlays, what-if situations, is important for the continuous
growth and maintenance of the process.

The sugar loss incurrs higher costs.


**TQM on superjam**

The extended control on supply chain enables changes to be made fairly
flexibly. Customer satisfaction maximisation is key for superjam, considering
their UVP and their appeal, the fact, that their real only UVP is their brand. 

**The balanced scorecard**

Limitations on past. Mostly focusing on assets, intangible assets such as
skills in labourforce.
