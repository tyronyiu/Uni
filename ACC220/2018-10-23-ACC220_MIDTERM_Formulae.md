## Break Even Point (BEP)

$$ \text{BEP is where,} \text{Total sales revenue }= \text{ Total Cost} $$
$$ \text{Total sales revenue} = \text{Fixed Costs + Variable Costs}$$
$$ \text{BEP } = \frac{\text{ Fixed Costs }}{\text{ Sales revenue per unit } - \text{ Variable Cost per unit }} $$

**Example:**  

- Fixed Costs = 500
- Material Cost = 2 per unit
- Labour = 10 per hour
- Retail Sales Price = 14 per unit

$$ \text{BEP} = \frac{500}{14 - (2+10)} $$

## Contribution

*Bottom part of the Break-even formula equals contribution per unit*

$$ \text{Contribution per unit} = \text{Sales Revenue - Variable cost per unit} $$

## Contribution margin ratio

The contribution from an activity expressed as a percentage of the sales revenue.

$$ \text{Contribution margin ratio} = \frac{\text{Contribution}}{\text{sales revenue}} * 100 $$

## Margin of safety

The extent to which the planned volume of output or sales lies above the BEP.

$$ \text{Margin of safety} = \text{Expected sales volume} - \text{BEP} $$

## Target Profit

$$ \text{Total sales revenue} = \text{TFC + TVC + Target profit} $$
, where TFC = *Total fixed costs* and TVC = *Total variable costs*

To achieve a desired target profit, calculations for required units sold can be made:

$$ n = \frac{\text{TFV + Target profit}}{\text{Sales revenue per unit - Variable cost per unit}} $$

### Total Cost

$$ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Overheads + Direct Costs} $$

$$ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Fixed Costs + Variable Costs} $$

### Batch Costing

$$ \text{Cost per unit} = \frac{\text{full batch cost (job costing
basis)}}{n_{\text{units}}} $$

### Full Costing

$$ \text{Full Cost} = \text{Direct Cost (mat.+lab.) + Indirect Cost} $$

### Cost per equivalent unit of output

$$ = \frac{\text{Total manufacturing cost}}{n_{\text{equivalent units of output}}} $$

**Example:**

--- | pounds
--- | ---
Materials | 1,680
Power for equipment | 140
Rent | 1,050
Equipment depreciation | 230
Labour | 1,920
Other | 260

$$ \text{Cost per equivalent unit} = \frac{1,680+140+1,050+230+1,920}{120+12} $$
$$ = \frac{5,280}{132} = 40 $$

Now, *Total manufacturing cost can be assigned to completely and partially completed units separately:*

--- | pounds
--- | ---
Cost of Completed units (120 * 40) | 4,800
Cost of partially completed units (12 * 40) | 480
*Total* | **5,280**


### Overhead absorption rate

Overhead absorption is a process by which overheads are included in the total cost of a product.

$$ \text{OAR} = \frac{\text{Total overheads}}{\text{Total Labour/Machine hours}} $$
