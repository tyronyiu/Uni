*The negotiation in question was held on the third of october.*

The parties negotiating were the stachonian government and the non-government organisations of stachonia.
The NGO affiliation won my membership for their team negotiation.
The discussion revolving the damn build was heated and energetic at first, but calmed to necessary levels later on. 
Problems that arose from early on were heavily reliant on the quantity of discussion contribution. 
Over the course of the negotiation the balance of contribution of each member dampened to an average.
The BATNA concept was most present out of the concepts studied, but PIOS was the second most present concept utilised.

The government party was more reliant on positions than interests, which is understandable given their standpoint of superior power. 
The non-government party was much more focused on options and interests, as the objective was clearly to reduce environmental impact and general footprint of the energy source.
The actual method of electricity production was vital, but not as much as the implied consequences.

Our BATNA was made up of the construction of the damn on a smaller scale. 
Preferred alternatives were the substitution of hydro-storage with solar or wind energy, though prevailing interest in the dam made convincing the other party a challenge.
The other party had their BATNA set out to not be the worst-case scenario, but rather any scenario worse than anticipated.
Due to the superior power that the government has relative to NGO's, ensured their sampling of such power within the negotiation.

The only way for us to reach a mutually acceptable agreement was to not abandon the government party's plan completely, but to add smaller aspects that turn the project more appreciated by the community. 
Additions to the agreement were made in form of "monetary funds for heritage site movement", "construction of museums for lost heritage" or "farmer subventions".

My specific role within the NGO party was the representation of the rural citizen of stachonia. 
Thus, the agreement's aspects directly and indirectly affecting people such as farmers etc. was my main concern.
Subventions delivered to farmers, funds for movement of settlings into more urban areas and employment of skilled, and unskilled labour for the construction of the site, were negotiated.
These aspects of the agreement were negligible for the government party, in terms of overall effect, but the impact on the citizens is drastic.
Thankfully, that made it fairly easy to negotiate terms acceptable to myself. 
In turn, other individuals pursuing their goals had harder circumstances, as their position was different in nature of mine.

The final agreement would have been able to be predicted, but the extend of the added aspects certainly not.
The overall outcome of the negotiation is acceptable, but more interestingly I believe, is the process, through which the whole group, as well as every individual had to go through, in order to be a constructive negotiator.
