\textit{E-sports} refers to video game competitions played by professionals and
watched by spectators, predominantly streamed from online. Even while not being
mainstream compared to more traditional sports, \textit{e-sports} is growing
continuously and outperforming predictions. The e-sports audience demographic is
young, majorly below 30, unlike traditional sports'. The realm is highly
segmented and not administered by central guidelines, which makes regulation
hard. Most professional sports leagues have adopted rigorous drug testing
regimens, similar work should be done for e-sports leagues, as most leagues do
not implement active doping policies or effective consequences yet.

Performance enhancing drug doping has become a known common ground for e-sport
tournaments since 2015, since which leagues like the \textit{electronic sports
league} has committed further to preventing PED's in its tournaments. Modern
techniques enable leagues non-invasive, quick testing on participants. With more
reliant methods being developed continuously which leagues are exploring and
investing research in, the problem lies within the post, to diagnosis of
drug use referring, handling, including consequences. Current problem ground
states the ambiguity of effect of frequently used PED's, like \textit{adderall}
or \textit{amphetamines} and their measurable reliance.
