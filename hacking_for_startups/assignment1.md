\begin{abstract}
A startup is a company that is not able to sustain itself without its founders,
which is the reason for the relevance of the founder when performing analysis in
the scenery of startups.  The \textit{Startup Journey} is the time-span from
even before the actual foundation of a \textit{company} and extends until the
definition of \textit{startup} does not hold on any further. Characteristically
this journey is defined by the key hurdles to be commonly overcome by the
founders and their startup in adjunction, which will be thoroughly analysed for
how they were accomplished. This Essay analyses the \textit{Startup Journey} of
\textit{Steemit Inc.}, \textit{"a social media platform built on a decentralised
database." (Chrunchbase, 2019)}. They utilise \textit{"Blockchain"} and
\textit{"Cryptocurrency"} technology to provide the users ownership of their
data and rewards for activity on the platform.

## Steemit Inc.

> *Steemit Inc.`s* product is *"a social media platform built on a decentralised
> database." (Crunchbase, 2019)*. They utilise *"Blockchain"* and
> *"Cryptocurrency"* technology to provide the users ownership of their data and
> rewards for activity on the platform.

### The Founding mission
 
Their *Mission Statement* is to *"make great communities with financial inclusion"
(About Steemit, 2019)*. 
When regarding the founder journey it is advantageous to unveil the brand and
product of the company in question. For Steemit Inc. the product is the
actual platform itself, because it is the reason for an increase in customers
count. When considering how Steemit may differ from a traditional startup,
because of its decentralised nature, it makes sense to consider their brand in
order to verify that the product is in fact as assumed, knowing what their goal
is (change in behaviour), how to achieve it (solution of a commercial problem)
and their audience and how those two relate to each other (partnership model &
business model). Thus, their vision:

> *"Our vision is that steemit.com is a vibrant communities web app, expanding
> the boundaries of community coordination and online discussion by
> incorporating cryptocurrency as incentives." (About Steemit, 2019)*

### Proposed change in behaviour

Knowing that, it is to be known to identify the brand, *Steemit's proposed
specific change in behaviour*. Above mentioned reason for incorporating
cryptocurrency as a technology, which is the ownership and reward of activity,
indicates the transition wished for. Henceforth, such transition would
be from the abandonment of current behaviour of giving up data easily for other
people's gain to the adoption of an envisioned behaviour of being rewarded for
online activity. Their tool to achieve that is again the underlying technology,
which is required for the reason of *why* said behaviour would be adopted. Such
reason is the realisation of the current circumstance and knowledge of a better
alternative, which offers actual gains for oneself. 

*Josephine: "Like we at Appics, they want to reward users with
cryptocurrencies for creating and curating content, activity. (... and appics
brand) Steemit is more of a new social media platform, but appics more of a
conjunction to existing or soon coming platforms."*

### Founder's Key capabilities
Steemit is a very complex and hard to actually make concrete. Steemit was
founded by two founders of which one was a blockchain developer, allowing him
to concretise their *problem-solution* fit. The capabilities for concretising an
undertaking as Steemit are thus dependent upon the skills to actually build a
prototype that solves a problem.

My Cousin doesn't know much about the technicalities of blockchain, but about
the networking and working around blockchain, thus she answered me from that
perspective.

*Josephine: "So, I dont know much about what you gotta be able to do,
skill-wise, but I know about the struggles in a blockchain startup from a
non-technical perspective.*

*There's a lot of hype currently regarding the topic that creates this
polarisation of opinions for many people. It is really hard for me to talk to
those that already have their minds set deeply in a belief about blockchain or
steemit from half-truths and out of stubbornness.*

*Also, I always get a mouthful when people ask me "if I really knew what I was
talking about" or "How does the CEO explain what you do", because it's hard to
get around the topic to other people and not everyone, not even in the
blockchain sector know much, actually, only a few really know what's going on."*

### Problem-Solution fit
This stage of the *startup-journey* is marked by the first meaningful solution
to a problem, which doesn't necessarily need to be a commercial one. Thus, being
the first prototype of the idea's physical representation. Returning users is
what is being seeked for, considering that a personal problem may be recurring
or repetitive among a population.

For Steemit, the problem-solution fit, was the creation of the blockchain
itself. As that is what solves the private problem, while the platform is what
solves the commercial problem. The commercial and private problem may coincide,
but should be distincted in isolation, as for some people, the private problem is only
solved with the commercial one.

Having users recurrently using the solution requires the solution to exist and
accessible. Not to loads of people, as the problem-solution fit doesn't require
the consensus of a majority, but rather the approval of the idea for the use of
solving a problem, again not necessarily a commercial one.

Josephine didn't really have much to say to this point:

*Josephine: "Steemit as many companies alike pivvot and needed to adapt their
vision to the reality of business. I think that's what's meant with the adoption
to a commercial problem, but I am unsure about how the first meaningful paint
started out. I know that Dan (Steemit co-founder, crypto-developer) probably did
it, but not how or the circumstances."*

### Product-Market fit
Product-Market fit is achieved after having a solution to a commercial problem.
For Steemit, that is the identification of the potential win-win situation that
social media consumers could find themselves in and the thus following
implementation of the idea towards that commercial problem. The commercial
problem is thus the difference between the *To-be* and the *As-is* situation.
That difference can even be quantified in terms of the money that one can gain
or the amount of data *not* given up when using Steemit.

*I asked Josephine: "What do you think is the commercial problem that Steem it
trying to solve?"*

To which she answered:

*Josephine: "Mhh, the problem is the situation the world of data is in and how
nobody cares et cetera, you know the drill, but that all is changing and the
awareness of the benefits of blockchain increases slowly but steadily. In a few
years, the use of instagram compared to a blockchain powered version would seem
like using horse carriages instead of cars.*

*The HOW they are going to do that is ha ha... blockchain, it solves the problem
by itself, because it allows people to do the things they are already doing but
better."*

So, from that we can deduce that blockchain is an *enabling technology*, which
solves product-market fit by itself, which seems odd at first, but becomes more
clear when considering the nature of it being *enabling*.

### Scaling fit
Gratitude to the fact of technology's progression today, it is very easy to
scale an operation such as Steemit's. In actuality, the nature of the underlying
technology, being blockchain, requires being scaled for its best effectiveness
of intended use.

The practical scaling is performed by hackers, decentralising and maintaining
the platform, as the protocol should handle scaling itself, by itself. The
underlying assumptions are that blocks are continuously mined for a continuous
STEEM token supply.
To that, my cousin had the following to say:

*Josephine: "Differently to bitcoin, they aren't intended to be used like a
currency, which is why the process of acquiring them is different. That's why, scaling
STEEM is also different. It won't end in being the third of the world's electricity
consumer ha ha."*

So, the mechanisms are different and that differs how to scale the system. The
decentralised nature relies on nodes instead of big servers, known from
traditional digital services and alike of how instagram, as an indirect
competitor, does it. For instagram to scale requires more processing and storage
capacity in physical form, for Steemit it means more users, as the users' device
is for-scaling required capacity.

### Competition lock-out 
Due to the competition being few to non-existent, there is little to lock out
for Steemit Inc. One could define competition so specific, that only companies
within the social media sector with the goal of rewarding users with rewards for
their activity. Where one could also argue, that such reward could be a better,
more tailored experience, which may be complemented in function with profiling
of ones data.

My cousin Josephine told me that Appics is not competing with Steemit.

*Josephine: "In a sense, we do the customer acquisition for Steemit. You know,
Steemit itself isn't making revenue from people using their platform, but from
the result of that, the platform growing. And we use their platform for our use,
which isn't a problem for Steemit, because its worth to them to have us grow
their network and tech.. But what Steemit will do in the future is another
question."*

> *"APPICS is a mobile social media application that runs on top of the STEEM
> Blockchain and was created with full support of Steemit Inc." (Announcing:
> Appics, 2019)*

That means, that there is no direct competition between Steemit and Appics,
which locks out most competition from above mentioned pool of possible companies
that could compete with Steemit directly.

When enlarging that pool and considering for example social media companies in
general, then companies like instagram are locked out via the barrier of
technology, which differentiates the two in how they change behaviour.

#### Identification of scarce-resource
The timing of the undertaking of the operation of Steemit Inc. is contributor to
one of the elemental scarce-resources being constituent parts of the company,
the developers and tech-savvy hustlers, hackers and hipsters confident in
knowledge and application of the employed bleeding-edge technologies.

Thus, as the resources to create such technologies is already a scarce resource,
the result of such is also a scarce resource, as the nature of such, out of
rarity created, resource needs to be out of few.

My Cousin agrees undeniably with this aspect:

*Josephine: "I have worked for a few years in the field now and I still don't
really understand blockchain itself. It's super hard to understand, especially
in context of like a business and an idea like Steemits' or Appics' so it must
be a hell of a lot harder to actually build these systems.*

*It costs a lot of money and also time. For me I always see the biggest consumer
of that in the communication problems between the tech guys and lets say
marketing or administration. I struggle a lot with them, or they with me haha,
because it is me who doesnt tells them clearly enough of what to do."*
