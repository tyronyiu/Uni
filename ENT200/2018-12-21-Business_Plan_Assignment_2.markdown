## Preface

I myself have built a few Neural networks that analyse data from sensors like
whether or not the light in my room is turned on, where I am et cetera, to
predict the likelihood of e.g. me being asleep, having something to eat, being
available for phone calls (based on where I am, who I am with and what I am
doing). Undoubtedly my biggest advancement in these Megatrends is an AI that can
identify my handwriting or differentiate between my personal belongings and the
belongings of my friends, given a few items from my personal collection. Having
built a Blockchain for my personal finance, including my debtors or entities I
have borrowed from, gives me insights into what my financial position is and if
I am likely to ask a friend for an injection any time soon or if they will. 

## Abstract

Megatrends are defining the future, technological advancements and progress
create these trends. The greater the advancement, the more likely the formation
of a megatrend. There are many Megatrends having emerged in the recent decade,
to limit the scope of consideration, this business model will implement Machine
Learning and Neural Networks to automate processes and deliver insights into
data collected. Blockchain is a trend regarding to security measures of data in
the digital space. Blockchain can be used in conjunction with ML/AI to create an
encapsulated, secure data analysis framework. Big data is the source of the data
to be analysed. It describes a large data set, to be analysed for patterns and
trends. AI is helpful to reveal correlations/patterns from cross-referencing
data, that seemingly, standalone, is irrelevant, but may lay out relevant info
after analysis. The implementation of these technologies and Megatrends are
still in an early-adopter phase, thus common integration is unlikely in the
short-term, but inevitable in the long-term.

## Background

**Neural Network** 
: A neural network mimics a specific cognitive function,
depending on the neurons and their links, the neural net can perform different
tasks. It is simply an input-output function.

**Machine Learning** 
: Machines learn by taking additional/new data into
considerations. A image recognition neural network can be combined with machine
learning to give more accurate results given an unknown input.

**Artificial Intelligence** 
: AI (combination of neural networks & machine
learning), in contrast to a normal set of instructions (program/script), it
performs adaptive cognitive functions. By being able to learn from data, it can
optimise itself when given new data.  Similar to how *Bayes Theorem* works, AI
takes multiple factors into consideration and can make relevant info from
seemingly insignificant data.

> E.g. Tinder knowing the location of their users. If wanting to know if two
> people actually met up (thus calculating effectiveness), tinder can check the
> proximity of both phones. Additionally, if the proximity is held for
> prolonged time, e.g. over night, a lot more can be revealed about the users
> than solely the fact of having met up.

**Blockchain** 
: Blockchain in itself is a superior database. They encrypt data
in the database and have very specific security measures. They have modern
algorithms like proof of work or proof of knowledge, consensus et cetera. These
algorithms make sure the data is always a truthful representation. 

**Business Intelligence**
: Strategies & Technologies for data analytics of business information. It is
referring to the past data.

**Predictive Analysis**
: Using **BI** (*business intelligence*) to determine future trends/patterns.
Modern technologies like AI can help significantly in cross-referencing BI data
in regards to the future. 

## Intro

**Techtelligence**

A new business, a startup in the data analytics sector, leverages modern
technologies and *Megatrends* to perform outstanding business intelligence and
predictive analytics about the market and its customers. *Techtelligence* will
use the insights gained to not only optimise its processes, but also to provide
those insights for other businesses as analytical reports. Thus,
*techtelligence* is providing a service similar to process optimisation. 

## Service range offered

*Techtelligence* is a service provider for businesses. These services have a
vast range, as does the applicability of these technologies.

### Business Intelligence

Business intelligence entails collecting data and analysing that in terms of
relevant factors. These factors can be various, such as Analysing customer
behaviours, buying patterns, sales trends, performance tracking, delivery and
supply chain effectiveness. Normally, dashboards, showing the relevant
information like sales today, vs sales last month, vs rolling average sales, is
how business intelligence is implemented, though the visualisation is not core
theme of BI. 

### Predictive Analysis

Having the data from BI, it can be extrapolated for generating potential future
circumstances. Possible use-cases can be forecasting sales and financial
performance, optimising processes, budgeting and financial predictions. All
these can be very easily observed when having the data of how the effectiveness
changed over time. A rise in sales can be tracked back to a specific reason.
The more data available, the more precise the reasoning and origin of change. 

### Customer service

Specific AI can be conversational. Examples like *Amazon's Alexa* or *Apple's
Siri* come to mind. These again, can learn from data about conversations. The
annoying nature of automated customer support is dated, as AI can revolutionise
this aspect of customer support rather drastically. The AI is able to identify
similar/equal queries and use FAQ's. *Chat-bots* are a modern approach to
handling such queries. The NLP (natural language processing) AI tracks actions
by users and can thus identify a most likely query, given the behaviour of the
user. Such would not be possible traditionally, as the data needs structural
storage for search, instead where an AI can embed the data in its neural
network in forms of biases towards a certain action. NLP AI's are specifically
tuned to identify and respond to language, spoken text (by transforming it to
text and using dictionaries/given texts, to give meaning to it). The best
factor to AI and using it for customer service is the predictive features of
AI, enabling it to proactively engage on issues or identify them before having
occured. 

### Process optimisation

> *Process optimisation is performed by AI, process innovation has to be conducted
> by humans.*

Process optimisation is the broadest aspect of AI and the most favourable. The
AI can have multiple inputs, such as video surveillance of manual labour taking
place, sound, transaction data, live video et cetera. These many inputs can be
correlated, meaning between sources can be implied. A falling object that
produces a sound in the same second in which the video shows it hitting the
ground can be interpreted by the AI as a action-consequence process. Thus,
whenever identifying a falling object, the following consequence is already
known. Having the real time input from manual labour, deficiencies and
inefficiencies enables the AI to improve on those areas.

> E.g. An assembly line, shows inefficiencies in some workers, the AI will
> realise, analyse and identify the reason for such inefficiency. Following, it
> can report suitable optimisation strategies to management to resolve given
> issues.

This relates to many business activities and strategies. Kaizen process
optimisation for example can rely on supportive recommendations from an AI.
Management can use an AI interface, to calculate predictive outcomes from a
potential strategy. Knowing given circumstances, the AI can run a simulation in
which the changes laid out are implemented and can tell how these changes
affect the business. 

### Financial analysis

Finance is a cost intensive aspect of a scaling business. Risk analysis is a
big part of finance and is very complex. AI with its superior processing power
can analyse financial prospects and compile portfolio analysis much faster and
given the machine learning aspect, can take several thousand aspects in
relation to finance and include them in the analysis. These jobs, in fact all
mentioned, can be performed by humans, but having seen AI as a tool of
optimisation that ties in with human innovation, it becomes clear that AI
implementation will remain supportive. 

#### Blockchain technology in finance

With recent trends like cryptography enabled coins on a secure database
(cryptocurrencies), Blockchain has made its entrance into the category of
Megatrends. The truthful effects of Blockchain on finance and business as a
whole has since shifted. Instead of being solely a transaction protocol,
Blockchain has proven itself as a secure/decentralised data storage. Blockchain
technology nowadays is starting a new megatrend, *block-supply-chain*. It
describes the storage of information regarding the supply chain of a business
on a Blockchain system, which will enable transparency and truthful
representation of facts. With Blockchain, every participating party in a supply
chain is on the same page, they have the same data. Thus, no item can be in the
same place at the same time, there are no misunderstandings and no unclear statuses of
inventory or delivery. Using smart contracts, two parties can engage securely
in a transaction without a third (governing/ensuring fairness) party. Thus,
Blockchain not only provides a tracking/referencing framework and currencies but
also enables two-way fair and secure transactions. (Transform Supply Chain
Transparency with IBM Blockchain. (2018)) In contrast to AI, it is a tool, not
an acting entity, thus has to be operated by an entity, which might as well
be an AI.

> reduced auditing could cover your entire
> blockchain investment"* (2018, EY)

## Business Model

> When referring to *the service* or *recommendations*, the above mentioned
> *service range offered* are meant. Including risk analysis, conversational
> customer service et cetera. 

*Techtelligence* Provides a modern and future proof *SAAS* (Software as
Service).  As described above, the business will perform data, intelligence,
predictive analysis. It could thus be seen as a kind of consultancy service.
Target audiences are businesses with the objective of optimising performance.
The nature of the business being digital, most costs will revolve around fixed
costs such as electricity and costs like computers, chipsets et cetera.

### Value proposition

The main value proposition is, as described by the nature of the business,
superior analytics and on such based optimisation strategies. Delivering high
quality analytics is increasingly important, not only for big businesses, but as
technologies scales and experiencing economies of scale in terms of costs, small
business can rely on such digitisation as well. 

### USP

Differentiation between *Techtelligence* and other analytics businesses, lies in
the cross-usage of AI and Blockchain. The brain being the many specialised AI's
and the memory being the Blockchain. Thus, blocks would be created by the AI's
instead of actual users. Therefore a faster algorithm of proof can be applied,
as proof of work is not necessary given the AI systems,proof of knowledge or
proof of consensus for example would be a more suitable solution. Many firms do
either of both, AI implementation into third firms or Blockchain solutions for
secure storage / supply chain management. By combining both aspects, the USP of
*techtelligence* becomes much more diversified and applicable for different
problem-cases. 


The *Techtelligence* management may/should decide to run all software as open
source, thus allowing the sharing of R&D costs. They should use
[www.Github.com](Github),it is a platform on which developers can collaborate on
software. Open source, does not mean that data is accessible to everyone. Solely
the core AI framework, the data will not be open source, as it may include
sensible information. The Blockchain will run separately from the AI systems,
but integrate in those. Thus, optimisations made from any developer on Github,
can be staged, tested and if better be run directly on the main Blockchain.

### Financial analysis 

#### Feasibility

Thankfully, AI, Blockchain, most of new Megatrends operate in the digital realm,
thus machinery must be provided for such systems to run. The NVIDIA DGX-1
chipset (NVIDIA DGX-1: Essential Instrument of AI Research. (2018)) is the most
adequate AI Deep learning platform as of now. Needed short term memory for the
AI, allowing learning will be provided by SSD racks directly bound to the DGX-1.
The Blockchain implementation will be run within the facility of
*Techtelligence*. Fixed costs will include rent, electricity & cooling, where as
variable cost is determined by the amount of hardware needed for the software to
run. The software itself, the AI and Blockchain infrastructure are capital
intensive set-up costs, but also require constant maintenance for staying
adequate and increase efficiency/reliability. 
The profitability of this company relies on the SAAS concept, in which e.g. on a
subscription basis firms receive analytics. 

#### Costs

What          | Count  |~ Price (unit) | Total
--------------|--------|---------------|-------
DGX-1 Chipset | 5-10+  | 40,000        | 280,000
SSD's         | 500+   | 1,000         | 780,000
Programmers   | 50-100 | 80/h          | 60,000


As seen above, the project is severely capital intensive, as hardware required
is still very expensive, due to the Megatrends using these still emerging. 

#### Sales forecast

Sales will be based on a subscription basis. Most AI services are low-cost as
they scale very easily. A best practice would be to get inspiration from
*Facebook's Messenger Chat-Bots* which can serve millions of
interactions/conversations per minute. Thus, cost for clients effectively
decreases over time and rising interactions. Acquiring between 5 and 10
clients in the start up phase, while still developing the infrastructure, will
be the ones training the AI in the beginning. Thus, it is vital that these
client acquisitions/relationship is leveraged completely. Creating a *win-win*
situation is key, as clients get more data collection sensors, get more accurate
insights, *Techtelligence* uses the data to train and optimise the AI for
further clients. The increasing effectiveness of AI will ensure a good
customer-relationship, as the service becomes better over time. Thus, the longer
a client stays with the service, the lower the cost relative to the received
result.

#### Initial investment 

Most emerging AI businesses have an average funding of over 20 million. That is
enough to cover the initial set up cost and provide a lasting burn period.
Luckily, the AI/Blockchain industry is booming and new entries rise just as much
as demand for said services. Thus, initial investment should be relatively,
compared to a e.g. construction company/tunnel boring company, easy to acquire.
Geographical areas such as *Silicon Valley or Silicon Roundabout* can be
leveraged. Having big firms such as *Google, Apple, IBM, EY et cetera* demand
and needing such services, increasingly in the future, will also increase
likelihood of receiving investment.

### Routes to market

As seen above, routes to market may be a difficulty, depending on the investment
received. The high initial capital will certainly be a barrier to entry to a
market and thus harden possible routes to market.

#### Unfair advantage

Thus, as a result of above described, the unfair advantage, even if systems are
made open source, is the infrastructure of the hardware, the seamless
integration of Blockchain and AI systems to provide all around *SAAS*. As also
known, AI's can be trained and optimise over time, thus the further into
operation, the bigger the advantage over emerging entries becomes. A more
reliable AI will be more applicable, as the trade-off between applicability and
reliability is a serious problem for most technologies.

### Problem-Solution / Prototype demonstration

*Techtelligence* identifies the problem of inefficiency in many firms, offering
their *SAAS*. The service will provide data collection instructions (or even set
up of e.g. cameras/sensors at the clients location.) and data analytics. After
the data has been collected, a small, *specialised* AI (again at the clients location)
structures the data and puts it onto the Blockchain of *Techtelligence*. From
here, the *big* AI, *Techtelligence's AI* accesses the Blockchain, verifies the
truthful representation with all other AI's (client's AI's) and stores it. Now,
the more capable AI's, running on the DGX-1 chipsets, begin data analytics of
the blocks on the Blockchain. As every block has been analysed, conclusions can
be drawn for each block. Meanwhile, because the blocks are added
chronologically, the main AI can also consider temporal factors, cross-reference
blocks from multiple businesses in the same industry, perform competitive
analysis et cetera. Furthermore, those recommendations will be put on a second
Blockchain, which will be accessed by the client's AI to extract meaningful
insights and recommendations based on such. The recommendations will become
increasingly more accurate, applicable and effective, as the outcome of an AI
generated recommendation can be measured and thus be analysed for effectiveness.

## Postface

*Techtelligence* will provide a AI/Blockchain data collection, structuring
and analysis service. The *SAAS* will be run on-site on external AI's
specialised in data collection and structuring. These AI's will tie in to the
main AI, operated by *Techtelligence*. The main AI will analyse the structured
data from the on-site AI's, learn from past data, optimise itself and draw
conclusions from the given data. Lastly, recommendations will be constructed,
specifically tailored to the client's circumstance, which become more adequate
to the client over time. These recommendations vary in nature and in area of
applicability. Some are solely applicable to financial analysis aspects such as
portfolio analysis, others to the customer service of the client, and some to
multiple processes. Depending on where the data is collected and what it refers
to inside the client's business, the AI will deliver recommendations for that
specific area or multiple, if it can cross-reference cause-effect relationships
between departments.

An AI business in itself can be so incredibly broad in definition. By tying
it in with Blockchain technology for LSTM (Long-short-term-memory), and
collecting necessary data via even more specific AI's, the business has a more
specific nature and better to achieve objectives.
