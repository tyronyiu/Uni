## Welcome Message from Sloan school website

**Getting Started**

You are the founder and CEO of Ty Industries, Inc., a startup company that has developed a set of technologies to improve the energy efficiency of commercial and industrial buildings. Your product consists of sensors, controls and software that integrate into a building's existing HVAC, lighting and other systems to optimize energy efficiency, enabling dramatic energy and greenhouse emissions-and financial-savings.

Though you don't yet have any customers, you have raised $1,000,000 in funding from friends and family, and now seek to introduce your innovative product to the marketplace. You will face competition from other startups with similarly innovative products and from large, incumbent firms such as electric utilities whose products may be less innovative but have deep pockets to establish their market presence. You must make a number of decisions each quarter as you build your sales and engineering team, try to win customers, and become profitable before you run out of cash.

Your business model seeks revenue from both initial product sales and annual maintenance fees. You set the price on the dashboard and maintenance fees are contracted at 5 percent/year of the sale price. Initially, your product costs $60,000 per unit to manufacture and install, but you expect that these costs will fall as you move down the learning curve and benefit from product and process innovation. Although you believe your product provides excellent value, building owners and managers are conservative and many are not aware of the potential for savings from this type of product.

To win customers, your product must not only be more attractive than that of competitors, but your sales people must work with customers to build their awareness and understanding of the product and its advantages. Given the unfamiliarity of potential customers with your technology, that process can take a long time. Your business plan anticipates a year or more to generate revenues.

In addition to setting prices, the dashboard enables you to manage employee hiring (and firing) and compensation. You decide how many people to hire, and how many are engineers who can improve the product and support existing customers, and how many are salespeople who can win customers. You decide compensation for your people, and what mix of salary, stock and stock options, and profit sharing to offer. You can decide whether to finance your company from earnings, whether it should be wholly or partially employee owned, or whether you will seek external funding from venture capitalists. Through the dashboard you'll have the option to communicate with prospective investors - both to seek venture capital and, if you are successful, to pursue a public offering. The dashboard also presents a wide range of information on your performance, so be sure to examine all the options thoroughly.

How long will the game last? The exact length of the game is up to your instructor, though you may go bankrupt sooner. As the founder of the business you're in it for the long haul. Your goal is to build a profitable, sustainable business.
