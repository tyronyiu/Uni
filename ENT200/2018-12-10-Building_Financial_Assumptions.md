In order to build prudent forecast assumptions must be premised around gradual
organic growth. Therefore, a gradual justification of potential sales alongside
reasonable and considered justification provides authenticity to your
projections. Therefore, any projections that avoid or do not follow similar
steps are difficult to justify. It must be noted, that other considerations
should be factored into your sales projections. These include competitor data,
industry and market influences, specific strategy or roots to market, internal
competences et cetera.

Build a justification for a business that has or is seeking multiple revenue
inflows.

The nature and objective of a business is to be profit generating. Hence, a
business has to have in-streams of money to sustain outflows. It is clear, that
multiple inflow channels offers the opportunity to balance, manage and allocate
stress on particular inflow channels.

Build financial assumptions and financial positions. Use comparative analysis,
at a macro level or a micro level. Exit strategy, contingency plans, et cetera.
