## Consequences of failure and executing pivots

- Forecasting (sales, finances, budget)
- Perform

## Forecasting *VS.* Actual performance

The difference between forecasting and actual performance determines wether a business is meeting or failing to meet its targets.

- Recognising and managing risk
- identifying and assessing the process

A risk register identifies potential risk accross the entire business. It also
identifies the likelihood of occurance.
It further includes specific resources that are responsible for identification
mitigation and management of the risk. The ability to identify appropriate risks is fundamental in recognising and managing risk.


## Contingency Planning

Contingency planning is based on establishing alternative strategies and processes in the event that the current processes or strategies fail.

> Contingency plans are based on the *what if* strategies.

## Managing a failing business

A failing business can be classified as one that has consecutive periods of poor
performance and needs to be restructured. Therefore, aspects of retrenchment,
restructuring, pivoting become essential. There are tools that support gathering
of relevant information in order to support the management of a failing
business. This includes an ERP system *(Enterprise resource planning)*.

> Examples of implementing retrenchment include automation and use of
> technology, downsizing of human resource and optimising current successors.

that cut across business in general and therefore both owners and customers
should be aware of the underlying influences and consequences.
