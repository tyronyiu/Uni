A business plan would have several sections that would inform its creation, these include an executive summary that provides an overview, followed by an industry product and service outlook.

This would be followed by an internal analysis of the business that includes:

- Market research
- Marketing plan
- Management plan
- development plan
- operational plan

These would be linked to the next phase that includes:

- critical risk analysis
- Financial plan
- A proposed offer or an investment request
