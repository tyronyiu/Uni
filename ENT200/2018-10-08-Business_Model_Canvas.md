## A practical look at the lean canvas and business model canvas

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoAOzMTLP5s]()

Using either the lean canvas or the business model canvas, identify differences similarities in the three businesses listed below.

1. Uber
2. Viavan
3. Citymapper

e.g. Citymapper smart-ride looking to fill gap between cab and bus where tfl is insufficiently covered.
Viavan for rideshares greater than four.
Uber more specialised for sole-riding or small-ride sharing.

> Price differences? 

People can switch between market segments within a day. e.g. in the morning a quick convenient route to Uni, vs to a more secure and direct route at nigth. E.g. Citymapper at day, Uber at night.

One other differences is the ownership of the asset (car).
To avoid huge capital investments.

The lean canvas and business model provide a foundation upon which the development of business models can be achieved. The canvas would utilise various processes, strategies and models, that include freemium, bundling, long-tail business model, open business model, subscription, etc.

## A word on pricing

Price skimming (exploiting high prices), no frills, cost plus pricing, Discounted pricing, premium pricing, competitive pricing, psychological pricing.
