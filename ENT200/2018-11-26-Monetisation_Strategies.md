The features of a product should change, not the product itself. E.g. Facebook
China. E.g. McDonald's India doesn't change beef

One of the main features of establishing multiple monetisation/revenue streams of a
product, is the establishment of a product/service that is standardised, yet
adaptive to different environmental variables. It is therefore paramount, to
establish a clearly defined persona, that adapts to different jurisdictional
variables. This also helps in establishing/building **Brand Equity**. This is
developed over time by establishing a clear *value proposition*, quality of
product/service, need, that is not only easily accessible, but outperforms most
of the alternative products in the market. However it is worth noting, that
people due to the advent/emergence of new technologies such as social media et
cetera, brands have managed to build equity in a much shorter period of time.
Examples include: COD, Pokemon, angry bird et cetera. Therefore, establishing
prudent,efficient and effective processes, that support the establishment and
creation of the factors, that lead to brand equity is not only significant, but
links to revenue streams, unfair advantage, the establishment of a sustainable
value proposition that will eventually lead to customer loyalty. Some of the
methods used for customer loyalty include loyalty programmes, price segmentation
(student discounts), establishing quality standards, guarantees and warranties,
establishing Peer & Trend driven runs. Strategy driven loyalty, especially
when you lock customers into purchase contracts. The establishment of
phase-payment plans that are linked to the establishment of short, medium and
long-term agreements. Although there are several other techniques and methods of
supporting and engaging customer loyalty, it is fundamental that the principles
utilised in the **KANO model** (Execution Vs. Expectations) performance related
variables.
