        - Combine all your research and observe where your user's problems exits.
- Explore
    - Ideate
        - Generate a range of crazy, creative ideas

Solution: In order to rent and roam, the user has to receive a scooter at an automated dispensary.
The return of the scooter is similarly done, by putting the scooter inside the receive unit.
Users will be encouraged to behave in such way, to not get charged for continuous usage.
As soon as a scooter is received at a station, the time-period of rental expires.
