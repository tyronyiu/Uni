Step 1.
: Identify a practice involving cyber-technology, or a feature in that technology, that is controversial from a moral perspective. 


1a.
: Disclose any hidden (or opaque) features or issues that have moral implications


1b. 
: If the ethical issue is descriptive, assess the sociological implications for relevant social institutions and socio-demographic and populations. 


1c. 
: If the ethical issue is also normative, determine whether there are any specific guidelines, that is, professional codes that can help you resolve the issue (see Appendixes A-E).


1d.
:  If the normative ethical issues remain, go to Step 2. 


Step 2.
: Analyze the ethical issue by clarifying concepts and situating it in a context. 


2a. 
: If a policy vacuums exists, go to Step 2b; otherwise go to Step 3.


2b.
:  Clear up any conceptual muddles involving the policy vacuum and go to Step 3.  


Step 3. 
: Deliberate on the ethical issue. 
  The deliberation process requires two stages: 


3a.
: Apply one or more ethical theories (see Chapter 2) to the analysis of the moral issue, and then go to step 3b.


3b.
: Justify the position you reached by evaluating it against the rules for logic/critical thinking (see Chapter 3).
