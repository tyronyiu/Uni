## Cybertechnology and Government Surveillance

As of 2005, cell phone companies are required by the FCC to install a GPS (Global Positioning System) locator chip in all new cell phones.
This technology, which assists 911 operators, enables the location of a cell phone user to be tracked within 100 meters.
Privacy advocates worry that this information can also be used by the government to spy on individuals.


## Discussion

Initially, privacy concerns involving computer technology arose because citizens feared that a strong centralized government could easily collect and store data about them.
In the 1960s, for example, there was talk of constructing a national computerized database in the United States, and many were concerned that George Orwell’s prediction of Big Brother in his classic book 1984 had finally arrived.

The centralized database, however, never materialized. 
Prior to September 11, 2001, some privacy advocates suggested that we have fewer reasons to be concerned about the federal government’s role in privacy intrusions (Big Brother) than we do about privacy threats from the commercial sector.

Is that assessment still accurate? Defend your answer.


## Here's how we take back the Internet

[https://www.ted.com/talks/edward_snowden_here_s_how_we_take_back_the_internet]()

Appearing by telepresence robot, Edward Snowden speaks at TED2014 about surveillance and Internet freedom.
The right to data privacy, he suggests, is not a partisan issue, but requires a fundamental rethink of the role of the internet in our lives — and the laws that protect it.
"Your rights matter,” he says, "because you never know when you're going to need them." Chris Anderson interviews, with special guest Tim Berners-Lee.


## Computerized Merging Techniques

Computer merging is a technique of extracting information from two or more unrelated databases and incorporating it into a composite file.
Computer merging occurs whenever two or more disparate pieces of information contained in separate databases are combined.  

Imagine a situation in which you voluntarily provide information about yourself to three different organizations – i.e., you give information about your:

* Income and credit history to a lending institution in order to secure a loan
* Age and medical history to an insurance company to purchase life insurance
* Views on certain social issues to a political organization you wish to join

Each organization has a legitimate need for information to make decisions about you; for example:

insurance companies have a legitimate need to know about your age and medical history before agreeing to sell you life insurance;
lending institutions have a legitimate need to know information about your income and credit history before agreeing to lend you money to purchase a house or a car.

Suppose that information about you in the insurance company's database is merged with information about you in the bank’s database or in the political organization's database.
When you gave certain information about yourself to three different organizations, you authorized each organization to have specific information about you.
However, it does not follow that you thereby authorized any one organization to have some combination of that information.


## Computer Merging Scenario

DoubleClick planned to purchase Abacus Direct Corporation, a database company, in late 1999.
Abacus’s databases contained not only records of consumer’s catalogue purchases but also actual names and telephone numbers that had been collected by Abacus primarily from offline transactions.
With this acquisition, DoubleClick could merge records in the Abacus database with its own database, which consisted of information gained primarily from Internet cookies files.
And with its newly merged data, DoubleClick would have an information mosaic about individuals that included not merely anonymous and indirect information (such as IP addresses and ISP-related information) but also direct personal information.
 The Web profiles in DoubleClick’s original database, gathered via cookies, included data about which Web sites that users (who are identified and tracked via an IP address) visit, how long they visit a particular site, and so on.
 That information would be able to be compared to and combined with explicit personal information (gathered offline and stored in Abacus’s databases), including names, addresses, and phone numbers.

If it had succeeded in acquiring Abacus, DoubleClick would have been able to merge on- and online records.

Double-Click backed on from its proposal to purchase Abacus, but many users were able to see for the first time the privacy threats that can result from merging electronic data.
In March 2008, it was acquired by Google.
This acquisition has caused concerned for many privacy advocates.


## Computer Matching

Computer matching is a variation of computer merging.
Matching is a technique that cross-checks information in two or more databases that are typically unrelated to produce "matching records" or "hits."

Income tax records could be matched against state motor vehicle registration records (looking for individuals reporting low incomes but owning expensive cars).
Consider an analogy in physical space where your mail is matched (and opened) by authorities to catch criminals suspected of communicating with your neighbors.

*Some who defend matching argue:*
If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to worry about.

*Others use the following kind of argument:*

* Privacy is a legal right.
* Legal rights are not absolute.
* When one violates the law (i.e., commits a crime), one forfeits one's legal rights.
  * Therefore, criminals have forfeited their right to privacy.


## Data Mining

Data mining involves the indirect gathering of personal information via an analysis of implicit patterns discoverable in data.
Data-mining activities can generate new and sometimes non-obvious classifications or categories.
Individuals whose data is mined could become identified with or linked to certain newly created groups that they might never have imagined to exist.

Why is mining personal data controversial?
Unlike personal data that resides in explicit records in databases, information acquired about persons via data mining is often derived from implicit patterns in the data.
The patterns can suggest "new" facts, relationships, or associations about that person, such as that person's membership in a newly "discovered" category or group.

Much personal data collected and used in data-mining applications is generally considered to be information that is neither confidential nor intimate.
So, there is a tendency to presume that personal information generated by or acquired via data mining techniques must by default be public data.


## Data Mining Scenario

Lee, a junior executive at ABE Marketing Inc., has recently applied for an automobile loan at the XYZ Bank.
To secure the loan, Lee agrees to complete the usual forms required by the bank for loan transactions.
He indicates that he has been employed at the ABE Marketing Company for more than 3 years and that his current annual salary is $240,000.
He also indicates that he has $30,000 in a separate savings account, a portion of which he intends to use as a down payment for a new BMW.
On the loan form, Lee also indicates that he is currently repaying a $15,000 personal loan used to finance a family vacation to Europe the previous year.


## Data Mining Scenario (cont)

Next, the bank’s computing center runs a data mining program on information in its customer databases and discovers a number of patterns.
One reveals that executives earning more than $200,000 but less than $300,000 annually, who purchase luxury cars (such as BMWs), and who take their families on international vacations, are also likely start their own businesses within their first 5 years of employment.
A second data mining algorithm reveals that the majority of marketing entrepreneurs declare bankruptcy within 1 year of starting their own businesses.
The data mining algorithms can be interpreted to suggest that Lee is a member of a group that neither he nor possibly even the loan officers at the bank had ever known to exist—viz., the group of marketing executives likely to start a business and then declare bankruptcy within a year.
With this new category and new information about Lee, the bank determines that Lee, and people that fit into Lee’s group, are long-term credit risks.


## Data Mining Scenario

*Lee, a (hypothetical) 35-year old executive named Lee, who:*

A data-mining algorithm “discovers” that:

* Applies for an automobile loan for a BMW;
* Has an impeccable credit history.
* Lee belongs to a group of individuals likely to start their own business;
* people who start business in this field are also likely to declare bankruptcy within the first three years;

Lee is denied the loan for the BMW based on the profile revealed by the data-mining algorithms, despite his credit score.
*Does the mining of data about Lee by the XYZ Bank raise concerns for privacy?*

Although the preceding scenario (involving Lee) is merely hypothetical, an actual case (that was similar to this) occurred in 2008.
In that incident, a person had two credit cards revoked and had the limit on a third credit card reduced because of certain associations that the company made with respect to where this person:

* shopped,
* lived,
* did his banking (Stuckey 2009).

In that (2008) case, a data-mining algorithm used by the bank “discovered” that this person (whose credit cards were revoked):

purchased goods at a store where typical patrons who also purchased items there defaulted on their credited card payments;
lived in an area that had a high rate of home foreclosures, even though he made his mortgage payments on time.


## Web Mining: Data Mining on the Web

Traditionally, most data mining was done in large “data warehouses” (i.e., off-line).
Data mining is now also used by commercial Web sites to analyze data about Internet users, which can then be sold to third parties.
This process is sometimes referred to as “Web mining.”


## Three Techniques Used to Manipulate Personal Data Data Merging

A data-exchanging process in which personal data from two or more sources is combined to create a "mosaic" of individuals that would not be discernable from the individual pieces of data alone.


### Data Matching

A technique in which two or more unrelated pieces of personal information are crossreferenced and compared to generate a match or "hit," that suggests a person's connection with two or more groups.


### Data Mining

A technique for "unearthing" implicit patterns in large databases or "data warehouses," revealing statistical data that associates individuals with non-obvious groups;
User profiles can be constructed from these patterns.
