## Learning Outcomes

What is ethics, and how is it different from morality or
a moral system?
What are the elements that make up a moral system?
Where do the rules in a moral system come from, and
how are they justified?
How is a philosophical study of morality different
from studying morality from the perspectives of
religion and law?
Is morality essentially a personal, or private, matter, or
is it a public phenomenon?
Is morality simply relative to particular cultures and
thus culturally determined?

Ethics and Morality
n

n

n

1.
2.

The term Ethics is derived from Ethos
(Greek), and Morality from Mores (Latin).
Both terms translate roughly into notions
affecting “custom,” ”habit,” and “behavior.”
Ethics is defined as the study of morality,
which raises two questions:
What is morality?
What is the study of morality?

Moral Dilemmas and Moral Issues
n

Not every moral issue (or moral problem) that
arises is (also) necessarily a moral dilemma.

n

A dilemma is a situation where one must
choose between two undesirable options,
which often leads to one’s having to choose
between “the lesser of two evils.”

Moral Dilemmas vs. Moral Issues
n
n

n

Not every dilemma is moral in nature.
The example of the “runaway
trolley” (Scenario 2-1 in the textbook)
illustrates a moral dilemma.
Most of the moral concerns/problems that
we examine in this course are moral issues (as
opposed to moral dilemmas).

The Runaway Trolley: A Classic Moral
Dilemma

Imagine that you are driving a trolley and that all of a sudden
you realize that the trolley’s brake system has failed. Further
imagine that approximately 80 meters ahead of you on the
trolley track (a short distance from the trolley’s staHon) ﬁve
crew men are working on a secHon of the track on which
your trolley is traveling. You realize that you cannot stop the
trolley and that you will probably not be able to prevent the
deaths of the ﬁve workers. But then you suddenly realize that
you could “throw a switch” that would cause the trolley to go
on to a diﬀerent track. You also happen to noHce that one
person is working on that track. You then realize that if you
do nothing, ﬁve people will likely die, where as if you engage
the switch to change tracks, only one person would likely die
What would you do in this situaHon?

The Runaway Trolley: A Classic Moral
Dilemma
Consider a variaHon of this dilemma, which also involves a
runaway trolley, but this Hme you are a spectator.
Imagine that you are standing on a bridge overlooking the track on
which a runaway trolley is traveling. You observe that the trolley is
heading for the staHon where there are many people gathered
outside. Standing next to you on the bridge is a very large and
obese person (weighing approximately 500 pounds), who is
leaning forward over the rail of the bridge to view the runaway
trolley. You realize that if you gently pushed the obese person
forward as the trolley approaches, he would fall oﬀ the bridge and
land in front of the trolley; the impact would be sufﬁcient to stop
the trolley. Thus you could save the lives of many people who
otherwise would die.
Would you be willing to push the obese person oﬀ the bridge? If
not, why not? What has changed in the two scenarios?

What is Morality?
n

n

Morality can be defined as a system of rules
for guiding human conduct, and principles for
evaluating those rules.
Two points are worth noting in this
definition:
¡
¡

n

morality is a system;
it is a system comprised of moral rules and
principles.

Moral rules can be understood as "rules of
conduct," which are very similar to "policies."

Directives
n

n

Directives are rules (of conduct) that guide
our actions, and thus direct us to behave in
certain ways.
Rules such as
¡
¡

"Do not steal"
"Do not harm others"

are examples of rules of conduct that direct us
in our individual moral choices at the "microethical" level (i.e., the level of individual
behavior).

Social Policies
n

n

Some rules of conduct guide our actions at the
"macro-ethical" level by helping us frame social
policies.
Rules such as
¡
¡

“Proprietary software should not be copied“
“Software that can be used to invade the privacy of
users should not be developed"

are both examples of rules of conduct that arise out
of our social policies.
n

Notice the correlation between directives and
social policies (e.g., rules involving stealing).

Principles
n

n

n

The rules of conduct in a moral system are
evaluated by way of standards called
principles.
For example, the principle of "social
utility“ (i.e., promoting the greatest good for
the greatest number) can be used to evaluate a
social policy such as
“Proprietary software should not be copied
without permission."

Principles (Continued)
n

A policy, X, could be justified (on utilitarian
grounds) by showing that following Policy X
(i.e., not allowing the unauthorized copying of
software) would produce more overall social
utility (greater good for society).

Moral System
Rules of Conduct
(Action-guiding rules, in the form
of either directives or social
policies)
two types

Principles of Evaluation
(Evaluative standards used
to justify rules of conduct)
Examples include principles such
as of social utility and justice as
fairness

Rules for guiding the
actions of individuals
(micro-level ethical
rules)

Rules for establishing
social policies
(macro-level ethical rules)

Examples include directives
such as:"Do not steal" and
"Do not harm others."

Examples include social policies such as:
"Software should be protected“ and
"Privacy should be respected."

Bernard Gert’s Scheme of a Moral
System
n

According to Bernard Gert (2005), morality is
a system that is:
¡

¡
¡
¡

like a game, but more like an informal game (e.g.,
a game of cards)
public (open and accessible to all)
rational (open to reason)
impartial (as illustrated in Gert’s “blindfold of
justice”).

Four Features of Gert’s Moral
System
Public

Informal

Rational

Impartial

The rules are
known to all
of the
members.

The rules are
informal, not
like formal
laws in a legal
system.

The system is
based on
principles of
logical reason
accessible to all
its members.

The system is
not partial to
any one group
or individual.

The Role of Values in a Moral
System
n

n

n

Values can be viewed as objects of our desires
or interests.
Examples of values include very general
notions such happiness, love, freedom, etc.
Moral principles are ultimately derived from a
society's system of values.

Intrinsic vs. Instrumental Values
n

n

n

n

Philosophers distinguish between two types
of values: intrinsic and instrumental values.
Any value that serves some further end or
good is called an instrumental value because it
is tied to some external standard.
For example, cars, computers, and money are
goods that have instrumental value.
Values such as life and happiness are intrinsic
because they are valued for their own sake.

Core Values
n

n

n

Another approach to cataloguing values is to
distinguish core values, some of which may or
may not also be intrinsic values, from other
kinds of values.
Moor (2004) argues that values such as life,
happiness, and autonomy are core values
because they are basic to a society's thriving
and perhaps even to a society's survival.
Not all core values are also moral values.

Three Schemes for Grounding the
Evaluative Rules in a Moral System
n

The principles are grounded in one of three
different kinds of schemes:
¡
¡
¡

religion;
law;
philosophical ethics.

Approach #1: Grounding Moral
Principles in a Religious System
n

Consider the following rationale for why stealing
is morally wrong:
¡

n

Stealing is wrong because it offends God or because it violates
one of God's (Ten) Commandments. (Christian Based)

From the point of view of institutionalized
religion, stealing is wrong because of it offends
God or because it violates the commands of a
supreme authority.

Approach #2: Grounding Moral
Principles in a Legal System
n

An alternative rationale would be:
¡

n
n

Stealing is wrong because it violates the law.

Here the grounds for determining why stealing is
wrong are not tied to religion.
If stealing violates a law in a particular nation or
jurisdiction, then the act of stealing can be
declared to be wrong independent of any
religious beliefs that one may or may not happen
to have.

Approach #3: Grounding Moral Principles
in a Philosophical System of Ethics
n

A third way of approaching the question is:
¡

n

n

Stealing is wrong because it is wrong (independent of any form
of external authority or any external sanctions).

On this view, the moral "rightness" or
"wrongness" of stealing is not grounded in some
external authoritative source.
It does not appeal to an external authority, either
theological or legal, for justification.

Approach # 3 Continued
n

Many philosophers and ethicists have argued
that:
¡

¡

n

independent of either supernatural or legal
authorities, reason alone is sufficient to show that
stealing is wrong.
reason can inform us that there is something
either in the act of stealing itself, or in the
consequences that result from this kind of act,
that makes stealing morally wrong.

Social disapproval - no punishment in a
formal sense.

The Method of Philosophical
Ethics
n
n

Philosophers use normative method to
analyze moral issues
Social scientists use the descriptive method
¡

¡

Sociological and anthropological studies are
descriptive because they describe or report how
people in various cultures and groups behave
with respect to the rules of a moral system.
For example, a sociologist might report that
people who live in nations along the Pacific Rim
believe that it is morally permissible to make
copies of proprietary software for personal use.
