Individual Report - Monday
Topic 4 debate - Thursday 13th of december

## What is a community?

- *"People living in the same district/neighbourhood"*
 
> What about communities where its nodes are millions of miles apart?  

Rheingold (2001) defines online communities as "comupter-mediated social
groups". Many people interact via *web-based social networking sites* (SNS's).
The members of a community can participate in social networks or blogs, have
news-feeds and can communicate via ``VOIP``. 

### Blogs as Online Communities

There are many different types of Blogs, such as:

- Political
- corporate
- health
- literary 
- et cetera  

## Perceived aspects of Online Communities

There are positive aspects, such as the ability to meet like minded people,
communicate with people where there normally would be a barrier of
communication. Interest groups can form and collaborate, share their results
with the public and community fans/members can read/watch/hear about via
newsfeeds on social networking sites.

There are also negative aspects, such as the possibility of the formation of
extremist and as such condensed focus groups that could do harm surpassing the
virtual realm. Also the exposure to negative groups can happen, which would not
have happened without these online communities. E.g. recruiting of teenagers by
extremists groups.

It is important to realise, that different circumstance in the real world have
different effects upon the usage/interpretation of the online realm and thus
online communities on one person. E.g. The loss of identity of an individual
among many other millions causes a different view on online communities than
compared to example a person that lives on a farm. These two people use online
communities for different objectives, they are affected by those differently.

Online communities can be leveraged by businesses (see *Adidas* campaign
including instagram voting and feedback for creating custom sneakers). 

## Social Polarisation

People tend to be attracted to other with like opinions. An increase in
prejudice will occur when being exposed to like opinions. This polarisation of
attitudes can occur on socially significant issues. Community fracture can be
one of many outcomes. 

## Virtual Environemnts and Virtual Reality

Online communities are also often referred to as virtual communities. They are
*"virtual"* in the sense that they exist in the cyberspace. How is a virtual
space different from a phyiscal space?

There are three different senses of *virtual*.

- Contrasted with "real"
- Contrasted with "actual"
- (FILL IN)

Brey (1999) defines virtual-reality (VR) as:

> A three-dimensional interactive computer-generated environment that
incorporates a first-person perspective.

The three imporant aspects to qualify as "virtual" are thus after Brey:

- Interactivity
- Three-dimensional graphics
- A first person perspective

Virtual Environments

- Online Communities (electronics forums, SNS's)
- VR technology
