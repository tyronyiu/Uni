  Introduction to privacy

## A Comprehensive Account of Privacy

Privacy, according to Moor:

“an individual has privacy in a situation if in that particular situation the individual is protected from intrusion, interference, and information access by others.”

### Nissenabum’s Theory of Privacy as “Contextual Integrity”

Nissenbaum’s privacy framework requires that the processes used in gathering and disseminating information are “appropriate to a particular context” comply with norms that govern the flow of personal information in a given context.

### Nissenbaum refers to these two types of informational norms as:

* norms of appropriateness 
* norms of distribution.

A given type of personal information is either appropriate or inappropriate to divulge within a particular context.
restrict or limit the flow of information within and across contexts.

When either norm is “breached,” a violation of privacy occurs.
The contextual integrity of the flow of personal information is maintained when both kinds of norms are “respected”

## Scenario

Professor Roberts teaches a seminar on social issues in compu5ng to upper division undergraduate students at his university.
Approximately half of the students who enroll in his seminar each semester are computer science (CS) students, whereas the other half are students majoring in humanites, business, etc. At the first class meetng for each seminar, Professor Roberts asks students to fill out an index card on which they include information about their major, their year of study (junior, senior, etc.), the names of any previous CS courses they may have taken (if they are non-CS majors), their preferred e-mail address, and what they hope to acquire from the seminar.
Professor Roberts then records this information in his electronic grade book.
Has Professor Roberts done anything wrong in requesting and collecting this information?
Suppose that Professor Roberts has lunch a few weeks later with a former student of his, Phil, who recently graduated and now has a job as a soJware engineer for a publishing company.
Phil’s company plans to release its first issue of a new magazine aimed at recent CS graduates, and it has launched an advertising campaign designed to aMract undergraduate CS majors who will soon graduate.
Phil asks Professor Roberts for the names of the CS majors in the seminar he is teaching.
Professor Roberts is initially inclined to identify some students that Phil would likely know from classes that he had taken the previous year at the university.
But should Professor Roberts reveal those names to Phil?

## Can Privacy Be Preserved in the Digital Era?

In 1999, Scott McNealy, CEO of Sun Microsystems, uttered his now famous remark to a group of reporters: You have zero privacy anyway.
Get over it.
Froomkin (2000), Garfinkel (2000), and others have expressed concerns about the “death of privacy.”
But some believe that not all has yet been lost in the battle over privacy.

Some privacy advocates believe that we should be vigilant about retaining and safeguarding what little privacy we may still have.

## Is Protecting Personal Privacy Still Considered an Important Goal?

Can the current privacy debate be better understood in terms of differences that reflect generational attitudes?
For many “Millennials,” who are now college-aged, privacy does not always seem to be of paramount importance.
Consider, for example, that many Millennials seem eager to share their personal information widely on social networking services such as Facebook.
But for many older people, privacy is still highly valued.
So the relative importance of privacy may vary considerably among the generations.

## What Kind of Value is Privacy?

Three distinct questions can be distinguished with respect to privacy as a value:

* Is privacy an intrinsic value, or is it an instrumental value?
* Is privacy universally valued, or is it valued mainly in Western industrialized societies (where greater importance is placed on the individual than on the broader community?)
* Is privacy an important social value (as well as an individual value)?

Is Privacy an Intrinsic Value or an Instrumental Value?

Is privacy something that is valued for its own sake?
In other words, is it an intrinsic value?
Or, is privacy valued as a means to some further end?
Is it merely an instrumental value?

Privacy does not seem to be valued for its own sake and does not appear to have intrinsic worth.
Privacy seems to be more than merely an instrumental value because it is necessary (rather than merely contingent) for achieving important human ends (Fried, 1990) such as trust and friendship.

## Privacy as a Universal Value

Privacy has at least some importance in all societies, but it is not valued the same in all cultures.

Privacy tends to be less valued in many nonWestern nations, as well as in many rural societies in Western nations.
Privacy also tends to be less valued in some democratic societies where national security and safety are considered more important than individual privacy (e.g., as in Israel).

Cybertechology-related Techniques that Threaten Privacy

We examine three techniques that threaten privacy:

data-gathering techniques used to collect and record personal information, often without the knowledge and consent of users.
data-exchanging techniques used to transfer and exchange personal data across and between computer databases, typically without the knowledge and consent of users.
data-mining techniques used to search for patterns implicit in large databases in order to generate consumer profiles based on behavioral patterns discovered in certain groups.

## Cybertechnology Techniques Used to Gather Personal Data

Dataveillance captures two techniques made possible by cybertechnology:

* surveillance (data-monitoring)
* data-recording.

Surveillance is neither a recent concern nor one that should be associated exclusively with the use of cybertechnology to monitor and record an individual’s online activities.
Surveillance has clearly been exacerbated by cybertechnology.

video cameras now monitor consumers’ movements while they shop at retail stores scanning devices used by “intelligent highway vehicle systems,” such as E-ZPass, subject motorists to a type of surveillance while they drive through tollbooths.
Sue Halpern (2011) notes that approximately 500 companies are now able to monitor and track all of our movements online.

## Internet Cookies as a Surveillance Technique

“Cookies” are files that Web sites send to and retrieve from the computers of Web users.
Cookies technology enables Web site owners to collect data about those who access their sites.
With cookies, information about one’s online browsing preferences can be “captured” whenever a person visits a Web site.

## Can the Use of Cookies be Defended?

Web sites that use cookies maintain that they are performing a service for repeat users of their sites by customizing a user's means of information retrieval.

For example, they are able to provide a user with a list of preferences for future visits to that Web site.

## Arguments Against Using Cookies

Activities involving the monitoring and recording an individual's activities while visiting a Web site violates privacy.
Information gathered about a user via cookies can eventually be acquired by or sold to online advertising agencies.

## RFID Technology as a Surveillance Technique

RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) consists of a tag (microchip) and a reader:

The tag has an electronic circuit, which stores data, and antenna that broadcasts data by radio waves in response to a signal from a reader.
The reader contains an antenna that receives the radio signal, and demodulator that transforms the analog radio into suitable data for any computer processing that will be done (Lockton and Rosenberg, 2005).

RFID transponders in the form of “smart labels” make it much easier to track inventory and protect goods from theft or imitation.
RFID technology also poses a significant threat to individual privacy.
Critics worry about the accumulation of RFID transaction data by RFID owners and how that data will be used in the future.

Garfinkel (2004) notes that roughly 40 million Americans carry some form of RFID device every day.
Privacy advocates note that RFID technology has been included in chips embedded in humans, which enables them to be tracked.

Like Internet cookies (and other online data gathering and surveillance techniques), RFID threatens individual privacy.
Unlike cookies, which track a user’s habits while visiting Web sites, RFID technology can track an individual’s location in the off-line world.
RFID technology also introduces concerns involving “locational privacy”

## Cybertechnology and Government Surveillance

As of 2005, cell phone companies are required by the FCC to install a GPS (Global Positioning System) locator chip in all new cell phones.
This technology, which assists 911 operators, enables the location of a cell phone user to be tracked within 100 meters.
Privacy advocates worry that this information can also be used by the government to spy on individuals.

## Discussion

Initially, privacy concerns involving computer technology arose because citizens feared that a strong centralized government could easily collect and store data about them.
In the 1960s, for example, there was talk of constructing a national computerized database in the United States, and many were concerned that George Orwell’s prediction of Big Brother in his classic book 1984 had finally arrived.
The centralized database, however, never materialized.
Prior to September 11, 2001, some privacy advocates suggested that we have fewer reasons to be concerned about the federal government’s role in privacy intrusions (Big Brother) than we do about privacy threats from the commercial sector.
Is that assessment still accurate? Defend your answer.

## Here's how we take back the Internet

[https://www.ted.com/talks/ edward_snowden_here_s_how_we_take_back_the_internet]()

Appearing by telepresence robot, Edward Snowden speaks at TED2014 about surveillance and Internet freedom.
The right to data privacy, he suggests, is not a partisan issue, but requires a fundamental rethink of the role of the internet in our lives — and the laws that protect it.
"Your rights matter,” he says, "because you never know when you're going to need them."
