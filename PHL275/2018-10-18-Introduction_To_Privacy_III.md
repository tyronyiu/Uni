## Public vs. Non-Public Personal Information

Non-Public Personal Information (or NPI) refers to sensitive information such as in one’s financial and medical records.
NPI currently enjoys some legal protection.
Many privacy analysts are now concerned about a different kind of personal information called Public Personal Information (or PPI).
PPI is non-confidential and non-intimate in character, and is generally not legally protected.

## Privacy Concerns Affecting PPI

Why does the collection of PPI by organizations generate privacy concerns?
Suppose some organization learns that that you are a student at HULT;
you frequently attend university basketball games;
and you are actively involved in your university’s computer science club.
In one sense, the information is personal because it is about you (as a person);
but it is also about what you do in the public sphere.

In the past, it was assumed that there was no need to protect the kind of information we now call PPI, because it was viewed as simply public information.
Nissenbaum (2004b) believes that our assumptions about not needing to protect PPI are no longer tenable because of what she views as a misleading assumption:

There is a realm of public information about persons to which no privacy norms apply.

## Two Scenarios

* Review Scenarios, which contrast shopping in a physical store
with shopping online.

One day, you decide to shop for groceries at SuperMart.
If I happen to see you enter or leave SuperMart, or if we are both shopping in
this store at the same time, I now have information that you shop (or, at least, have once shopped) at SuperMart.
(This information could be considered “public” because it was acquired in a
public forum and because it is neither intimate nor confidential in nature.)
If I also happen to pass by you in one of the aisles at SuperMart, I can observe
the contents of your shopping basket; I may notice that you are purchasing
several bottles of wine but relatively little food.
Again, I have acquired this information about you by observing your activity in a public forum.  

## Two Scenarios

Imagine that you visit an online bookstore called Nile.com to locate a particular book that you are considering purchasing.
Because you are visiting this bookstore via a computer or electronic device located in your own home, you cannot be observed by people in physical space nor can you be seen by other customers on the Nile.com Web site.
However, from the moment you log on to Nile.com, information about you is being intentionally gathered and carefully recorded—i.e., information about the exact time that you entered Nile, as well as the exact time that you leave.
As you make contact with the Nile Website, Nile requests a cookie file from your computer to determine whether you have previously visited this site.
If you have visited this site before and have clicked on items that interested you, Nile can find a record of these items.
The information stored in that cookie file can also be used by Nile to alert you to newly released books that it believes might interest you, based on an analysis of the data Nile collected from your previous visits to its site.

## Google Scenario

In 2005, the George W. Bush administration informed Google that it must turn over a list of all users’ queries entered into its search engine during a 1-week period (the exact dates were not specified by Google).
But Google refused to comply with the subpoena on the grounds that the privacy rights of its users would be violated.
Both Yahoo Inc. and Microsoft Corp. MSN, companies that operated the second- and third-most-used search engines, respectively, also had their search records subpoenaed by the Bush administration.
:x
It was not clear whether Microsoft also turned over its records to the government, since it declined to say one way or another.

## Can Technology Be Used to Protect Personal Privacy?

Privacy advocates tend to argue for stronger privacy legislation.
But groups in the commercial sector tend to oppose strong privacy laws, arguing instead for voluntary industry self-regulation.
Can Privacy Enhancing Tools, or PETs, provide an acceptable compromise?

## Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs)

PETs are tools that users can employ to protect:

their personal identity, while navigating the Web;
the privacy of their communications (such as email) sent over the Internet.

Two challenges involving PETs with respect to ordinary users include:

educating ordinary users about the existence of these tools;
preserving the principle of informed consent for users who opt for these tools.

## PETS and the Problem of Informed Consent

Users can (consent to) enter into an agreement with Web sites that have privacy policies.
Currently, however, users must typically “opt out” of having data about them collected.
The default view is that users have opted in, unless they specifically indicate otherwise.
Also, it is not clear that PETs protect against nonconsensual uses (e.g., secondary and future uses) of one’s personal data (as the Toysmart incident, described in the textbook, suggests).

### Discussion - Privacy Legislation and Industry Self-Regulation

Can industry adequately self-regulate privacy through voluntary controls, instead of strong privacy legislation?
What kinds of assurances from vendors do online consumers need regarding the protection of their privacy?

## INTRODUCTION TO SECURITY

What is cybersecurity, and how are security issues involving computers and cybertechnology different from privacy issues in cyberspace?
How are violations involving cybersecurity similar to and different from issues of cybercrime?
Which key features differentiate data security, system security, and network security?
What is “cloud computing,” and which kinds of challenges does it pose for cybersecurity?

## Computer/Cyber Security

The expressions computer security and cybersecurity generally refer to com- puter/ cyber-related concerns affecting:

* reliability,
* availability,
* system safety,
* data integrity,
* confidentiality,
* privacy.

## Defining Computer Security

Epstein (2007) suggests that computer security can be defined in terms of three elements:

* confidentiality,
* integrity,
* focuses on protecting against “unauthorized persons gaining access to unauthorized information.” as “preventing an attacker from modifying data.”
* accessibility,
* “making sure that resources are available for authorized users.”

Neumann (2004) notes that in addition to providing desired confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility, computer security has also a “more general purpose.”
In Nueman’s view, security in the context of computer systems also aims at preventing:

* misuse,
* accidents,
* malfunctions.

## Computer Security and Computer Crime

Virtually all known violations of security involving computers and cybertechnology are also criminal in nature.
But not every instance of crime in cyberspace necessarily involves a breach or violation of computer security.

## Computer Security Issues as Distinct from Computer Crime

Some cyber/computer-related crimes have no direct implications for cyber/computer security.
Consider, for example, that someone can use a computer or an electronic device to:

* make unauthorized copies of software programs;
* stalk a victim in cyberspace;
* bully someone online;
* elicit sex with young children;
* distribute child pornography;

Note, however, that none of these (criminal) acts are a direct result of insecure computer systems.

## Security as Related to Privacy

Privacy-related concerns often arise because users are concerned about losing control over ways in which personal information about them can be accessed by organizations (especially by businesses and government agencies), who claim to have some legitimate need for that personal information in order to make important decisions.
This is not the case with security-related concerns.

Cyber-related security concerns (unlike those of privacy) typically arise because of either:

* fears that many individuals and organizations have that their data could be accessed by those who have no legitimate need for, or right to, such information;
* worries that personal data or proprietary information, or both, could be retrieved and possibly altered by individuals and organizations who are not authorized to access that data.

Privacy and security concerns can also be viewed as two sides of a single coin, where each side of the coin also complements and completes the other.
Sometimes the objectives of privacy and security seem to be at odds with each other, causing a tension between these two notions.
Perspective of security, note that many people wish to control information about them themselves, including how that information is accessed by others.
Protection of system resources and proprietary data is generally considered more critical, from the point of privacy the protection of personal information and personal autonomy will receive a higher priority.

## Three Aspects of Cybersecurity: Data, System, and Network Security

Security issues involving cybertechnology span concerns having to do with three distinct kinds of (computer-related) vulnerabilities, which include:

unauthorized access to data, which either is resident in or exchanged between computer systems (i.e., data security);
attacks on system resources (such as computer hardware, operating system software, and application software) by malicious computer programs (i.e., system security);
attacks on computer networks, including the infrastructure of privately owned networks and the Internet itself (i.e., network security).
