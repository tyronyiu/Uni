  Introduction to privacy

## Outline

How are privacy concerns generated by the use of cybertechnology different from privacy issues raised by earlier technologies?
What, exactly, is personal privacy, and why is it valued?
How do computerized techniques used to gather and collect information, such as Internet “cookies” and radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, raise concerns for personal privacy?

## Privacy and Cybertechnology

Privacy issues involving cybertechnology affect all of us, regardless of whether we have ever owned or even used a networked computer.
Consider the amount of personal information about us that can be acquired from our commercial transactions

Ex. in a bank or in a (physical) store.

Closed circuit television cameras (CCTVs) located in public places and in shopping malls record many of your daily movements as you casually stroll through those environments.
Current Web-based applications such as Google Street View, make use of satellite cameras and global positioning system (GPS) software that enable users to zoom in on your house or place of employment and potentially record information about you.


Using the Internet solely for recreational purposes, your privacy is threatened.

Personal data, including data about our Webbrowsing interests, can now easily be acquired by organizations whose need for this information is not always clear.

A user’s personal data acquired via his/her online activities can be sold to third parties.

Privacy concerns affect many aspects of our day-to-day lives – from commerce to healthcare to work.

We have categories such as:

* Consumer privacy
* Medical/healthcare privacy
* Employee/workplace privacy

Are any privacy issues unique to cybertechnology?

Concerns have been exacerbated by cybertechnology in at least four ways, i.e., by the:

* Amount of personal information that can now be collected;
* speed at which personal information can now be transferred and exchanged;
* duration of time in which personal information can now be retained;
* kind of personal information (such as transactional information) that can be acquired.

What is Personal Privacy

Privacy is a concept that is difficult to define.
We sometimes speak of an individual’s privacy as something that can be:

* lost,
* diminished,
* intruded upon,
* invaded,
* violated,
* breached.

Privacy is sometimes viewed in terms of something that can be diminished (i.e., as a repository of personal information that can be eroded gradually) or lost altogether.
Privacy is sometimes also construed in terms of the metaphor of a (spatial) zone that can be intruded upon or invaded.
Privacy is also sometimes analyzed in terms of concerns affecting the confidentiality of information, which can be breached or violated.

Why Privacy matters?

![](https://www.ted.com/talks/ glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters)

Glenn Greenwald was one of the first reporters to see — and write about — the Edward Snowden files, with their revelations about the United States' extensive surveillance of private citizens.
In this searing talk, Greenwald makes the case for why you need to care about privacy, even if you’re “not doing anything you need to hide."

## Classic Theories of Privacy

Traditional (or classic) privacy theories have tended to view privacy in connection with notions such as:

* non-intrusion (into one’s space),
* non-interference (with one’s decisions),
* having control over/restricting access to one’s
* personal information.

## Non-intrusion Theories of Privacy

Non-intrusion theories view privacy as either:

* being let alone,
* being free from government intrusion (into
* one’s physical space).

> Accessibility privacy (DeCew, 1997).

* Non-interference Theories of Privacy

Non-interference theories view privacy in terms of freedom from interference in making decisions.

## Decisional privacy.

* The Control and Limited Access Theories of Informational Privacy

Informational privacy is concerned with protecting personal information in computer databases.
Most people wish to have some control over their personal information.
“Privacy zones” can be set up either to restrict or limit access to one’s personal data.

## Three Views of Privacy Accessibility Privacy

Privacy is defined in terms of one's physically "being let alone," or freedom from intrusion into one's physical space.

Decisional Privacy
: Privacy is defined in terms of freedom from interference in one's choices and decisions.

Informational Privacy
: Privacy is defined as control over the flow of one's personal information, including the transfer and exchange of that information.

## A Comprehensive Account of Privacy

Moor (2004) has articulated a privacy theory that incorporates key elements of the three classic theories According to Moor:

> “An individual has privacy in a situation if in that particular situation the individual is protected from intrusion, interference, and information access by others.”

Moor also distinguishes between “naturally private” and “normatively private” situations required for having:

* Natural privacy (in a descriptive sense);
* A right to privacy (in a normative sense).

Using natural/normative privacy distinction, we can further differentiate between a:

* loss of privacy,
* violation of privacy.

## Scenario 1

Mary arrives in the computer lab at her university at 11:00 PM to work on a paper that is due the next day.
No one else is in lab at the ?me that Mary arrives there, and no one enters the lab un?l 11:45 PM, when Tom—the computer lab coordinator—returns to close the lab for the evening.
As Tom enters, he sees Mary typing on one of the desktop computers in the lab.
Mary seems startled as she looks up from her computer and discovers that Tom is gazing at her.
Did Mary lose her privacy when Tom entered the lab and saw her?
Was her privacy violated?

## Scenario 2

Tom decides to follow Mary, from a distance, as she leaves the computer lab to return to her (oﬀcampus) apartment.
He carefully follows her to the apartment building, and then stealthily follows Mary up the stairway to the corridor leading to her apartment.
Once Mary is safely inside her apartment, Tom peeps through a keyhole in the door.
He observes Mary as she interacts with her laptop computer in her apartment.
Has Mary’s privacy been violated in this scenario?

## Nissenabum’s Theory of Privacy as “Contextual Integrity”

Nissenbaum’s privacy framework requires that the processes used in gathering and disseminating information are:

> “appropriate to a particular context” comply with norms that govern the flow of personal information in a given context.

Nissenbaum refers to these two types of informational norms as:

* norms of appropriateness,
* norms of distribution.
* Norms of appropriateness
* Norms of distribution

A given type of personal information is either appropriate or inappropriate to divulge within a particular context.
Restrict or limit the flow of information within and across contexts.

When either norm is “breached,” a violation of privacy occurs.
The contextual integrity of the flow of personal information is maintained when both kinds of norms are “respected”.

## Scenario

Professor Roberts teaches a seminar on social issues in computing to upper division undergraduate students at his university.
Approximately half of the students who enroll in his seminar each semester are computer science (CS) students, whereas the other half are students majoring in humanbusiness, etc. At the first class meeting for each seminar, Professor Roberts asks students to all out an index card on which they include information about their major, their year of study (junior, senior, etc.), the names of any previous CS courses they may have taken (if they are non-CS majors), their preferred e-mail address, and what they hope to acquire from the seminar.
Professor Roberts then records this informa?on in his electronic grade book.
Has Professor Roberts done anything wrong in requesting and collecting this information?

Suppose that Professor Roberts has lunch a few weeks later with a former student of his, Phil, who recently graduated and now has a job as a soZware engineer for a publishing company.
Phil’s company plans to release its first issue of a new magazine aimed at recent CS graduates, and it has launched an advertising campaign designed to a ract undergraduate CS majors who will soon graduate.
Phil asks Professor Roberts for the names of the CS majors in the seminar he is teaching.
Professor Roberts is initially inclined to identify some students that Phil would likely know from classes that he had taken the previous year at the university.
But should Professor Roberts reveal those names to Phil?

## Can Privacy Be Preserved in the Digital Era?

In 1999, Scott McNealy, CEO of Sun Microsystems, uttered his now famous remark to a group of reporters: 
You have zero privacy anyway.
Get over it.
Froomkin (2000), Garfinkel (2000), and others have expressed concerns about the “death of privacy.”
But some believe that not all has yet been lost in the battle over privacy.

Some privacy advocates believe that we should be vigilant about retaining and safeguarding what little privacy we may still have.

Is Protecting Personal Privacy Still Considered an Important Goal?

Can the current privacy debate be better understood in terms of differences that reflect generational attitudes?
For many “Millennials,” who are now college-aged, privacy does not always seem to be of paramount importance.
Consider, for example, that many Millennials seem eager to share their personal information widely on social networking services such as Facebook.
But for many older people, privacy is still highly valued.
So the relative importance of privacy may vary considerably among the generations.
