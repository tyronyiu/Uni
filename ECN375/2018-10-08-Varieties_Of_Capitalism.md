**Varieties of Capitalism among Rich Nations**

‘Varieties of Capitalism’ theory (Hall, Soskice et al) 
LME Liberal Market Economy (UK, USA)
Versus CME - Co-ordinated Market Economy (Germany, Scandinavia Japan)


* ‘Hierarchical’ Capitalism...steep inequality, poor development of human capital, low political rights (like Authoritarian or Oligarchi)
* Palan et al ‘State Strategies’ suggests
  * ‘Offshore’ strategy
  * Welfare (‘shielder’) strategy
  * ‘Hegemony’ (an alternative view of the US as user of international power for national advantage)
  * Big internal market (EU as a bloc)
  * Repressive/low wage exploiter strategy
* Nordic Capitalism
  * Ambiguous mix of entrepreneurialism, high tech high welfare, high tax— ‘socialisation’ of risk and costs provides welfare safety net and high education  and thus flexibility

### We already noted questions and dispute about 

1. Which model is superior?
2. Do they compete”
3. Is there convergence towards a common model?
4. We might also ask, Are the models accurate depictions?

## Is the US really ‘free market capitalism’? ‘neoliberal’?

The model: Private Enterprise and free markets run the economy and achievements are solely responsible for innovation, American tech leadership.
Some say neoliberalism was never about ‘free markets’...its more like class biased regime: State aid for business, but not labour. (Chomsky et al)
Others insist US tech advantage and firms have been greatly promoted by government.
* Block – there is a ‘hidden developmental state’ in US (giving diffuse) support to business/tech)
* Weiss – the key driver of US state support is national security machinery and purposes
* Mazzucato illustrates the role of government in recent digitech/smart phone development

This brings us back to the question ‘which model is superior’.
If Block and Weiss are correct Litan is wrong that American success is due purely to free market entrepreneurialism
There is also a wider and more explosive issue—does the US government use America’s world role to compete and pursue power or for common/cosmopolitan aims?

## Change in Europe

Sweden and Germany have so transformed their model that critics complain the virtues of the social model have been destroyed.

## How to understand European change

* Some (Hall et al) say its not convergence but adaption
* Others (Streeck et al) say its destruction of social cohesion but worldwide neoliberalism...
* ....followed by blowback - political extremes - in Europe (and advanced world)
* K Thelen says: There is still coordination (of government and firms and – some – unions)....
* but coverage of union agreements is less...less workers have rights and there are less worker rights and more workers flexibility/insecurity
* So government still  aids firms competition but workers position and social cohesion is worse
* Thelen says ‘co ordination and egalitarianism have become separated’ (Europe has lost some of its ‘social’ aspect)


## International Interactions and competition? A case study of america’s world role

### American power and rother nations

* Reform in other nations. Was this spontaneous reform or convergence—or a power play?
* The 1990s was a watershed: Alongside the rhetoric of superiority of US capitalism and necessity that others become more similar to it in order to survive globalization (‘convergence’)
* The US government used considerable power to press others to reform and shape their policy and political economy.


### East Asian economies

* were pressured for capital account liberalization (US influence in the IMF also used to pressure this)
* One result was a region-wide meltdown of currencies in 1997-8. Which in turn the US Treasury used to pressure for ‘structural reform’ of the Asian mercantilist catch up model


### Japan

* Long subject to similar pressure; according to Werner key elements of Japanese elite (esp Bank of Japan) finally accepted reform and blew up bubble in order to rationalize ‘need for reform’.
* Result was decades-long stagnation and end of the Japanese growth miracle


### Eastern Europe

<pre>
American advise on marketization of post-communist economy
insisted on radical shock therapy and rapid rush to liberalization.

                          |
                          |
                          |
                          v

Result was industrial collapse in many places, dissolution of political 
and economic ties of the Bloc and unity of USSR, and emergence of 
oligarchic dominance of resources—Gangster capitalism as some labelled it.

</pre>


### Western Europe

* goaded if not forced into ‘reform’ to fight eurosclerosis and to match purported American model for innovation-success
* Indications that Europe is not becoming a space more amenable to US capitalism:
1. Trade clashes (Trump and before)
2. Regulatory clashes with Us tech-giants

-----------------------------------------------

* Neoliberalism and ‘Reform’ proposed by US cannot be considered optimum or successful strategy  in many places (Russia, Less Developed nations, Japan, East Asia).
* Ironically...IMF recognized that China’s continued mercantilist model much more successful growth and post-communist reform model than neoliberal nostrums preferred by IMF and USA.
* But what it did do was remake other political economies closer to US preferences and interests (access for Wall St financiers in East Asia etc)....and dent degree of competitive difference to US capitalism (‘threat’ of Japan has disappeared)
* Was American policy a neutral calculus of common necessity or a competitive strategy of (political-economy) ‘regime change’?
* This leads us to question the wider nature of US world role.


## Gowan and Stokes – 3 conceptions of America’s world economic role

1. Mercantilist
2. Liberal-Multilateralist
3. Global-ImperialNotice how each perspective can be supported by some facts about US post war world role, but which one best accounts for all?


## Nationalism

* Pursuit of Us national interest.
* Sometimes by narrow mercantilism—eg protectionism.
* But for some openness can also be selfish-nationalist. Post war drive towards global opennessalso to the advantage of certain (esp US) preferences more than others
* Also does the US derive special advantages in world money and finance – because of the role of the dollar/Wall Treasury nexus?
* Despite driving trade liberalism – US diplomacy often pursued specific markets and played ‘hard=ball’ on trade
  * US diplomacy towards Europe and Asia placed heavy pressure to reform towards American style model—which was actually more prone to problems and thus not ‘for the good of global capitalism’
  * Again evidence here Japan’s stagnation,leveraging the Asian financial crisis for US/Wall St agenda, general globalising of the bad habits of Wall St banking and causing the 2008 crash


## Liberal multilateralism

* Reconstructing Europe and Japan
* Creating a multilateral international regime
* Leading the way towards increasing integration....seen as a public good
* Generous openness to others exports...often in the face of mercantilism (Asian exporters)
* American markets as persistent engine of world growth–allowing others to use export surpluses
* Provider of international political order and security in an integrated world
* Promoter of political and economic liberalism – said to be the best possible regime for global capitalism and international coexistence


## Global primacy

* Not narrow selfish purposes – but not mere servant of globalisation – its primary power and organiser
* Reconstruction of post war capitalism (esp. Germany and Japan) proves selfish mercantilism does not fit. But other examples of ‘Nationalism’ are correct, but not narrow purpose.
* Sometimes sacrificing narrow nationalist interests to play role of ‘global leader’
* Key is not narrow national benefit (indeed Trump shows how many inside US lost to globalism). 
* Key is not simple benefit to US as a whole but a global primacy project for UScapitaland US state—conceived not as identical to the national economy (still less all citizens), but as a dominant organ in a global order
* Advantage of this perspective is it can explain all the examples of both other perspectives


**Robert Litan**  - Blue sky innovation and silicon valley most likely to thank for US's technologic advancement.

## Oligarchic capitalism

The objective function of leaders is not coincidence with expanding people's welfare. 
People would challenge economic and political authority.


## State guided capitalism

The State undertakes commercial economic activity and where the means of production are organized and managed as state-owned business enterprises.
When a government is behind the economic frontier, the government can view at leading parties and apply concepts.
Growing fast by catching up with already existing methods, is not impressive.


## Big Firm capitalism

Western Europe, Japan
Economies of Scale, lots of resources for RND and Capital
limits: Do not invest in new methods. Innovation or current methods?


## Do models compete?

* If 2 is correct, US world leadership is benign and serves all interests in the global economy
  * Because there is one global regime that is optimum for globalization—and provided/pursued by the US
* If 1 or 3 are correct, US leadership pursues American power
  * If 1 is true, that is a narrowly nationalist advantage
  * If 3 is true this aims to provide a regime for wider benefit of global capitalism....but under American primacy (US as benign leader not servant)


## Now?

* Does Trump signal a major shift?
* His is not a retreat to ‘Isolationism’. It mixes ‘America first nationalism with continued ‘leadership’ perspective but conceived more narrowly—hence complaints of globalists and allies that he is leaving a ‘vacuum’ of power
* But in so far as the thrust is towards demanding a renegotiation of the (economic) burden of leadership (NATO) and global integration (NAFTA, world trade generally)...his demands are not new.
* Nixon and Clinton both did this in quite different ways
* But neither of them refracted (still less considered captive of) mass ‘populism’ (though Nixon was on the defensive in an era of radicalizing)
* Does Trump also represent a coherent elite/business interest in favour of narrower nationalist policy?
* In the 1930s the shift to really radical mutual damage and collapse of global integration only came when elites made the shift to harder nationalism. Deflecting from discontent by feeding mass populist nationalism is one thing—but an aggressively narrow nationalist foreign policy requires (some) elite support or will face opposition. Is Trump facing more opposition than support from the elite currently (is his tax giveaway and radical push towards more business freedom and power an attempt to move this?)
