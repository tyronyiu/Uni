## Late developer mercantilism

**Mercantilism** 
: A common historical pattern for 'catch up' and 'late development'. Mercantilism can also be described as economic nationalism by recent developments.

Late developers strive to create capitalism, but also protect and promot industry against displacement threat of superior competitors.
Includes 19th Century Europe and US but even gree traders once were mercantilists.

**Herman Schwartz** says that Industrial leaders are a displacement threat to latecomers.\\
There are two strategies to deal with it, *Ricardian* strategy, supplying industrial leaders with primary produce instead of competing.\\
*Kaldorian* strategy, grow to compete with leaders (needs state protection, and will get this, as these industries are where the money is.)

## The 'Developmental State'

Is a model based on common features of successful C20th *catch-up* economies.
Developed by analysing the east asian miracle economies like Japan, China, Singapore etc.\\
Their states were even more activist than earlier late developer protectionists.

### All late developers all sought promoted industry but...few achieved ‘catch-up’

All developing nations undertook ‘Import Substitution Industrialisation’.
But the most successful rapidly developed exportcapacity. (North East Asia the most successful, Latin American less).
States owned (eg Taiwan) and directed industry (Industrial policy)

### Japan - The prototype

<pre>

C19th - Conscious unified elite ---+   MITI promote industry
imposing 'revolution from above'   | 
                                   |
                                   |
Post war statism-------------------+-> Bank of Japan (window guidance)
                                   |   force private finance to fund industry
                                   | 
Result - Rapid foundation-laying, -+   Ministry of Finance control of finance
then move up the value chain           and currency (blocking lare foreign 
                                       international movement and foreign control)
                                   
                                   

</pre>

### Korea

Like Japan.
Government agencies favoured industrial sectors to protect and promote.
Government forced finance to invest specific industries.
Ownership of industries concentrated and interlocking (*Chaebols*)

### Singapore - Quite an exception

1. Distinct variant
2. Large state role
3. State pushed to boost labour intensive export industry
4. Much more interested in attracting FDI

## Successful catch up as rival Authoritarian/State capitalist model?

<pre>
 +----------------------------------------------+
 | Statism is provocative.                      |
 | It clashes with claims that Neoliberal and   |
 | American capitalism is superior and          |
 | challenges the doctrine of free trader       |
 +----------------------------------------------+

                      |
                      |
                      |
                      V

 +-------------------------------------------------+
 | Liberals respond, that Its still not clear the  |
 | states can ‘pick winners’, so statism is not    |
 | the key to East Asian success.                  | 
 | It’s a  crude strategy that works only for early|
 | industrialism involving copying with low wage   |
 | labour. Not innovation.                         |
 +-------------------------------------------------+
</pre>

### TL;DR

Is american capitalism really a *free market*? 
The interaction between capitalist models and between nations. 
Is there tension and competition or cooperation and global coordination?
Why and how some moderls reformed themselves (e.g. Europeans).
